| 0:00:56| I'm trying to look for a way to stall here for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| Waiting for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| Since we're stalling, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to take this minute to recognize Drusilla Stills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| who's the manager of the County Commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| for taking the initiative to contact the Public Building Authority to get these fixed so they don't squeak anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=75)|
| 0:01:24| Are you happy now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| We appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| We're waiting for the mayor and youth leadership Knoxville 2018 class to come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| They should be here any minute, unless the mayor's taking a lot of selfies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| Aren't we doing a presentation for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Yeah, we've got a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| I'll start off by acknowledging elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| Mayor Burchett's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Superintendent Bob Thomas is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| You're going to notice a large group of young people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| This is youth leadership Knoxville's class of 2018, and they are here to observe how county government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=142)|
| 0:02:32| Also in the crowd, we have a very special guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| And, sir, I hope I pronounce your name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| General Jack DeRouge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Can you come down, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=165)|
| 0:02:55| The mic's all yours, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| And thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing us to take some time before your meeting here to present a special award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| And before I do, I'd like to ask my colleagues from the employer support to the Gardner Reserve to please join me up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=189)|
| 0:03:18| And I'd like to ask Colonel Retired Richard Julian to please join us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=198)|
| 0:03:42| Ladies and gentlemen, the award I have to present on behalf of the employer support to the Gardner Reserve to Colonel Retired Richard Julian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| is what we call our Above and Beyond Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| It's one of the higher awards that we can present, and it is usually reserved for those who do go the extra mile in actions to support our guardsmen and reservists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=234)|
| 0:04:07| Thanks to the efforts of Richard and the mayor himself, Major Burchett, and this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| you have set the standard regarding supporting our guardsmen and reservists by extending military leave to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| As a result of this precedent, we've been able to convince the folks in Anderson County to follow suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| and we're hopefully going to use the work that you all have done here as a precedent to expand the program even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| I will tell you from personal experience, any time we needed to get help from the Knox County office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=280)|
| 0:04:48| anything to do with the military, the support of veterans of the Gardner Reserve, our go-to person has been Colonel Richard Julian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=288)|
| 0:04:59| And it is for this reason, Richard, we recognize you for going the extra mile for your duty above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| I want to thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=306)|
| 0:05:25| We have another recognition. We have the advantage of having our State Chair, Brigadier General retired Jim Munganast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| who has a token as well and has a few words to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| Thank you very much, General Tarrouge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Mr. Chairman and Commission, as Jack said, this is a big deal to get these additional days for our Gardner Reserve folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=341)|
| 0:05:52| And we are hoping to get this statewide with some of the other city and mayoral councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| But what I wanted to say is that Colonel Julian, since the time he left the Guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| he has been part of our local committee and has done a lot of work with our other employers in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| And we really appreciate all he's done, not just the work with you all in changing the policies for military leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| but everything else that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| So for that, I'd like to give you our treasured ESGR coin in thanks and also my personal coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| And with that, he should never have a problem buying a drink for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you very much. I've never had trouble buying a drink for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| I would like to say thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| I'll accept this on behalf of the Commission and the mayor, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| None of the things that I've done for the military could be done without the support of the mayor and you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| And just one thing I would like to say on behalf of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| when I came to work, our organization that took care of our veterans was somewhat shaky, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=428)|
| 0:07:18| Since then, with the hiring of Buzz and Tom Humphreys and Mark Glett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| we're probably the best in the state of Tennessee in taking care of our military folks in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| if not in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| So thank you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=454)|
| 0:07:47| Next, we'll move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Tom Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=470)|
| 0:08:05| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Sir, could you state your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| My name is Thomas Luke Driscoll, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| I live at 609 Coram Road, Knox County, Tennessee, where I had 12 of my cars stolen a few years ago by Grant Rosenberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=493)|
| 0:08:23| and one of his inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| My mailing address is post office box 14424, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=507)|
| 0:08:37| And you could write me a letter on this subject at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| I'm still here to see about getting compensation for the vehicles that were stolen by Rosenberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| and his partners in crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| Like I say, I was within the law of Knox County at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| I don't know if it's changed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| I was in jail until about 6 that evening until they could get the cars out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| and it was in the wintertime, so it got dark at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| And they left all the good ones and took the best ones and left the least ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| and haven't come back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| That's been a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Like I say, I talked to, who was that fellow that's, oh, Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=569)|
| 0:09:38| That's him, Dave Wright, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| He represented the East Knox County area where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| I'm on Coram Road off Strawberry Plains Park, three miles from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| He said we could get back together and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| Like I say, as of today, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| And same thing with Mary Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| He said we could get together and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I talked to him as I handed him a package of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| at the new Carter Elementary School groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| And I haven't heard from him since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| But if anybody is watching on the TV channel, public TV channel, I'll be on there next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=611)|
| 0:10:20| And then I'll be back here next month with more to the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| But I'm waiting on a couple of things, a couple of folks to contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| before I finish the whole story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| But I would like to say that this is the way government works in some parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| I'm in the east side of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| And you can have your property stolen, stolen in a criminal manner, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| And nobody does anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| I filed a complaint in federal court on my own with no help whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| It was ignored totally, federal court here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| And it just depends on who you are in this county if you ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| well, the newspaper won't tell you a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| And channel 6, channel 8, channel 10, if you catch up a tree, you know, give them a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| Otherwise, you can forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| And there are some, let's see, what do you call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| Well, some folks that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Advocates, that's what, advocates, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| They will help you if you talk to the right ones and nobody's looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| But if anybody has anything stolen in this county, I'd advise you to document it very thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=705)|
| 0:11:54| and have witnesses to that documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And maybe even have witnesses when the thieves come to your house to steal it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| being the county government thieves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| I knew they were coming, but I just didn't have witnesses to round up at that time, or I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| But only in East Knox, Tennessee, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Like I say, nobody will tell you about it except maybe some newspapers here and there, but not the TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| Talk radio is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| I guess that's all I've got to say, guys and girls and ladies and gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| and neighbors and friends and innocent future victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| But, you know, it's just a shame that nobody's going to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| Once again, post office box 14424 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914-865-235-9656 is the phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=773)|
| 0:13:10| Call me any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| If my dog answers, just say woof, woof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=791)|

| 0:13:18| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Which way is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| To the members of youth leadership Knoxville, this is how government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| It's called free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Next up, Madeline Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=812)|

| 0:17:08| honoring Ruth Ann Hanahan for her many years of service to Knox County Stormwater Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1028)|

| 0:17:26| Mayor Burchett, would you like to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| Whereas Ruth Ann Hanahan recently retired after 20 years as the local director of the Adopt-a-Watershed Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| through which she coordinated water quality education in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| And whereas during her tenure, Ruth Ann taught 28,600 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| and provided significant assistance to over 350 teachers in 15 Knox County middle and high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| as she raised awareness of water quality issues to thousands of families in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| And whereas Ruth Ann managed the Knox County AmeriCorps water quality team overseeing 136 members through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1079)|
| 0:18:09| Whereas Ruth Ann's leadership and guidance, the Adopt-a-Watershed Program flourished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| and was introduced into the Knox County schools curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| And whereas Knox County desires to recognize Ruth Ann for her service to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| and extends its appreciation for her lifelong dedication to educating students on the importance of water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| Now, therefore, it is resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| The Knox County Commission and Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett hereby honor Ruth Ann Hanahan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| for her contributions to our community and for raising awareness of water quality issues throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| Be it further resolved that this resolution to be presented to Ruth Ann Hanahan will be further resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| and this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| Am I recognized? I'm recognized. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Hey, thank you so much, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| It's always a pleasure working with great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| It's stated in the resolution that Ruth Ann has done a great deal for our community and our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| promoting water quality education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| I always remember Ruth Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| They wrote down the name of it, but I remembered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Families in the Creek Fish Assessment in Beaver Creek, because I believe we were shocking fish, weren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| And I had a leak in my boot, and you were shocking county mayors that day, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| So I always remembered that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| But thank you so much for what you do for our young folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| My daughter and I, she will tell you who the best crawdad catcher in North America is, and it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| So we practice catch and release, I want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| And we appreciate all the great work you do, and I want to present you with this proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| And also I'm going to ask Chris and Tanya to come up here and say a few brief words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| Here, you want to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Come over here, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Y'all come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Don't act like you've never done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| Why don't we open it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1208)|
| 0:20:25| Do I need to be recognized here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| I wanted to say, as you know, I run the Stormwater Management Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| We're asked to do a lot for the county's EPA requirements, and a lot of that, as you know, may not be entirely popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| But one of the things that has always been popular is the water quality education that Ruthann has provided on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1243)|
| 0:20:53| And I just wanted to say that her service with Knox County has been a tremendous asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| She'll be sorely missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| There's a whole generation or two who benefit from what Knox County has been able to do with Ruthann's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| So we appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Hey, guys, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| It's a little easier over here than it is over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you, commissioners, for letting us recognize Ruthann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| I got to experience Ruthann firsthand being a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| And I would guess that she probably allowed me to teach or I was able to teach ten more years at least because of her efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1291)|
| 0:21:45| and because of the things she did for us in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| She was an amazing resource with people and curriculum and all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| And so those of us that are sort of tree hugger, land, water guys, she was just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1315)|
| 0:22:04| So we're going to miss her and thank you for recognizing her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you so much for all of these incredible accolades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| Mayor Burchett, county commissioners, Tony, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| it's been such an honor to be able to work with such an incredible, talented stormwater staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| and all the support that they have provided along with the water quality forum here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1353)|
| 0:22:43| which we are very, very fortunate to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| And I would be very remiss if I also didn't thank CAC and their AmeriCorps program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| because when it really comes down to it, much of the good work that's done within our community related to water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| the boots on the ground go back to our AmeriCorps members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| And last but not least, I really would like to give a warm thank you to my colleague, Tim Gangaware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| with the University of Tennessee Water Resources Research Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| that's been my greatest support over this last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| I will continue to don my waders, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| and this spring I will plan to be out, as I hope you all will, April 6th for a river rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| We'll all still be out there cleaning up our creeks and rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| So I am not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I will still be working in First Creek in Fountain City as a homeowner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1432)|

| 0:24:24| Honorary Resolution 103, I'm going to add it and then defer it to next month whenever we get to the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1464)|

| 0:25:21| The two schools I represent in my district are Central High School and Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| Fulton lost Xavion Dobson to murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| With having these two schools and to see how the schools have come together to love each other even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| and to support each other and the families has just said so much about District 2 and my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| So for the devotion today, I just wanted to remind everybody and let everyone know that this is the Day of Remembrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1551)|
| 0:26:03| And it's tragically each year an estimated 14,249 people are murdered nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1563)|

| 0:26:33| is to make a difference through ongoing emotional support, education, prevention, advocacy, and awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1593)|
| 0:26:45| The POMC's vision is to provide support and assistance to all survivors of homicide victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1605)|
| 0:26:55| while working to create a world free of murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| And as you know, we've had two big cases, if you've been following the news, which were murder victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1619)|
| 0:27:08| So I just wanted to bring awareness, hope for the victims, and to recognize my two schools who have suffered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1628)|
| 0:27:18| the whole thing that I just described about emotional and advocacy and offered their peer groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1638)|

| 0:27:36| as we remember those who have lost their lives and especially their families who are left to carry on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1656)|
| 0:27:46| So Reverend Harold Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| Members of the commission, shall we pray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1672)|

| 0:28:07| Thou who gives unto us the privilege of having government representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1687)|
| 0:28:16| and who helps us to remember the least, the lost, and the left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1696)|
| 0:28:27| We pray at this commission meeting that our hearts will be moved to remember all of these families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1707)|
| 0:28:38| Families of our children, families of loved ones, who remember now and who suffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1718)|
| 0:28:49| because somebody did not act as though they cared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| And as we remember them, we remember all of these who suffer across this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| Help us to be motivated and to share with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| For but for the grace of God, it could be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| And now we ask you to bind us together as a nation, one nation under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1761)|
| 0:29:30| And help us to never forget that it is our responsibility to care for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| We pray it now in the name of the one who loves us so much that we are granted life daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=1779)|

| 0:53:27| Do you want to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3207)|

| 0:53:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Texas said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| 803, approving a grant contract in the amount of $3,482,625 with required local matching funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3220)|
| 0:53:50| in the amount of $1,263,806 with the State of Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3230)|
| 0:53:58| for the provision of pre-arrest diversion infrastructure for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Okay. Before we go forward, I think if we have a motion on the floor, we can get no input from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| And Ms. Cook has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Ms. Cook, would you like to go ahead and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| Your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| I am a resident in the area where the Urgent Care Center is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| And I've gone through this contract, and I suspect that it's probably a fait accompli since there already was a groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| But I wasn't able to attend that groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| I went over there, but I had somebody come up to me with a policeman telling me that it was by invitation only, and I had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3292)|
| 0:55:00| So that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| You know, if that's the attitude that people want to take, I understand why it's necessary to have those closed sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| But I'm going to speak very quickly, because I have a lot of questions here, and I have very little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| What we are concerned about in the neighborhood are certain issues that relate to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| And I'm going to go over them quickly, and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| So if you have any that hit you in the right place and you want to follow up, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| I just want to get these on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| The first item I want to address is performance and reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| There are nine specific reporting requirements identified on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| We are asking if there will be others, and if so, who will define those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| We want to know who is specifically monitoring performance on this grant and on the grants from the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| I don't know if you know this, but this grant is overfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| If you take a look at the dollars that were required by the state for the match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| and compare them to the dollars that the city and county have contributed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| there are more dollars there than need be based on what was submitted as proposed costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| So somebody needs to be watching out to make sure that the state dollars are spent first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| and then the county and city dollars, and you can decide what you're going to do with what's left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| There was an early diversion program that was run by Helen Ross McNabb from 2013 through 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| for which they got a million dollar grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| They were supposed to divert 1,250 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| It's this same program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Our question is, did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And during that period of time, they were supposed to have a 14% success rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| for case managers out of that grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| We want to know if, in fact, 14% case management is all that can be expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| out of these millions of dollars that are going to this program from the state and from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| We also want to know if the information pertaining to the individuals that were served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| under that early diversion program would become a part of the database of clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| that are going to be served within the new facilities in order to really track recidivism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| which was or seemed to be a key important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| Number four, the state grant contract calls for a community policing station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| and a reception center that has a televideo magistrate link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| Now, in all the discussions, this has never been brought up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| We in the community would like to know if that community policing station is in the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| for that building, and if so, how big is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| And what kind of community interaction will there be in that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| Number five, we're looking at the qualifying charges for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| that are supposed to be availing themselves of these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| On pages one and two of the attachment to, there are nine low-level charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| and the DA is able to approve some folks out of jail who have been in jail for 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3508)|
| 0:58:38| And what we want to know, two things, are the previous records for those individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| not just the low-level charges they're presently being arrested for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| are the previous records being considered for those individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| and how will those records be made known?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| So, that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| Oh, I know, the state grant also calls for four detox beds in a medical unit supervised by a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| In the staffing section, there's two physicians, one at .34 and one at .05,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3556)|
| 0:59:27| for a total of .39 physicians that are going to be staffing those four detox beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| So, we're just questioning whether that's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| And I just wonder if the folks, never mind, I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| I don't want to zing you anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Have at it, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| It's your project now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| They didn't fix mine, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Is there a way to get Ms. Cook to leave her questions where there was no way for us to write all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3598)|
| 1:00:07| to try to help answer her questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Can you provide us with a copy of those questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Is there anybody from Helen Ross McNabb here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| Jerry, do you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3618)|
| 1:00:30| Jerry Wagner, Helen Ross McNabb Center, 201 West Springdale Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you, Commission, for all of your support to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| and wanted to provide what I think is some response to a few of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| Commissioner Carrington, I'm not sure I wrote them all down either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| but I think I got the gist of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| With regard to performance reporting, who monitors performance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| State of Tennessee monitors performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| That's the Department of Mental Health Substance Abuse Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| They're the required entity that's giving the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| and it's their responsibility to monitor that performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| So, that's who will be doing that with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| And they're accustomed to doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| They do this on every performance contract that the state issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| and they're very specific in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| So, I think that's pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| With regard to the grant being overfunded, there is a 25% cash match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| that's required under this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| The city and the county funds are going to meet or exceed that cash match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| It is likely that not all of these funds could be utilized in the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| If that's the case, then those funds just wouldn't be expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| It would be our hope, and we have had some assurances from the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| if there are funds left over, that those would roll forward into the following year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| and they would be accessible to Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| With regard to the early diversion project, we had a federally funded project from 2013 to 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Ms. Cook is correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| What is probably not evident to her, when you look on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| it talks about our initial application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| When you have an approved application with the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| in particular this was the mental health portion of our federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| they come back later, they do a revision of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| which we did do a revision of our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| So, the volume of people seen was not to the extent that our initial project had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| but that was all approved by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| The difference was, once we got involved in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| these were very difficult to engage people and clients in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| and we had a tremendous amount of success, actually, through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| I think I've got a few of those summary points in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| This was a project that was only one of three projects for early diversion funded in our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| So, it was very exclusive that we were given the award to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| We've been cited on the federal website in their newsletter for our accomplishments and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| The number of days of incarcerated pre- and post-involvement with our service was reduced by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| So, 51% of the days that people spent in jail prior and post were reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3785)|
| 1:03:14| Total cost was, as you would imagine, because of that reduction in jail days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| was about half what it was pre-involvement with our early diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| There was a 67% arrest decrease rate for the people that we were involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| So, if we were involved with somebody who had repetitive crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| and we had somebody like a case manager involved with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| they had a 67% reduction in their subsequent arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| We thought that was pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| The number of people who received alcohol and drug treatment went up 187%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| just by us being there and connecting them to resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| and their own frequency of drug use reduced by 26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| So, we're very proud of that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| and I'd hate to walk away with you all having the impression that we didn't do a good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| It is on their website, and it came through the Department of Mental Health as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| who is funding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| With regard to the community policing station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| we had that in our initial application a year ago summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| We always said there would be law enforcement on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| and then subsequently the sheriff said he would man that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| In our design, there is an office dedicated to the police officer who would be housed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| There is a dedicated room where we would have the televideo equipment in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| It's before you enter the treatment space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| So, if you remember the project, people have to come with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| They have to hear what their charge is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| and then they have to agree to participate in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| So, it all happens before they ever enter the treatment space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| and that's intentional by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| So, we fulfilled the obligation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| With regard to adequate staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| we have to meet licensure staffing for detox to keep our license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| The Department of Mental Health comes in and evaluates our staffing patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| Our physician's staffing is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| So, it meets or exceeds the staffing requirements for four beds of detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| Jerry, I have a couple questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| You said the state will be monitoring that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Who will be monitoring our portion of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| What kind of reports and tracking will there be to give us feedback on how efficient this is working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| Yeah, it's a good point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| So, our contract with the county is evaluated by county purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and those specifications are in our agreement with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| So, I assume at this point, like our other contracts, that's done by purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| They're the ones who evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| And has there been a matrix or any kind of report for evaluation done yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| I think that's to be determined at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| I think they were waiting for all of the monitoring pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| from all the three funding sources to come together before all of that was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| In the state contract, there's four detox beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Where will they be housed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| So, these detox beds will be in our alcohol and drug facility, which is at Centerpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| So, that is outside of this facility, and we will not have people in those detox beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| who are in this diversion project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| There will be post-diversion, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| So, they will not be arriving by police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| No, not for these beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Yeah, Jerry, in regards to how she was talking about the money being spent and overfunding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| if there's ever a term for that in government, I guess there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| How are we spending the dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Are we spending state dollars first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Are we doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| How are we doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| It's a 75-25 match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| So, for every $3 you pull down for the state dollar, you have to put a dollar in from the local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| So, there's no ability to overexceed that match in that format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Jerry, did you find out any more about the driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| To this point, I have a meeting with City Codes on Wednesday, and we're going to have that final discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| If you're not aware, there is a blue line stream where we would like to put the requested alternate entry point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4034)|
| 1:07:22| on our driveway, and that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| There has to be an opinion given by TNAC that says that's no longer a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| That's the issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| So, we're waiting for that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| We have a motion before us for the proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| And no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| We have a discussion of items to be presented at the upcoming County Legislative Delegation and Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4081)|
| 1:08:11| Mr. Chairman, if there be no objection, since that's on my name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| I'd like to yield the floor to Commissioner Daley to hear the next item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4098)|
| 1:08:26| so we can get that out of the way and then the rest of the business is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| Discussion regarding the status of Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Mr. Dillingham, making his way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| I was at a meeting a couple weeks ago, or I guess last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| and a couple of citizens wanted an update on Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| and we kindly gave Mr. Dillingham a whole week to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| Hopefully those two individuals are watching, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Doug Dillingham, Director of Facilities and Construction, Knox County School, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| I can tell you that we didn't get finished in the week that you gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| They are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| At this point, the interior is probably between 85% and 90% complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| We actually have furniture scheduled to be coming in on the 9th of October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| so two weeks from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| and they are in the process of trying to get all flooring installed, all the painting done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| glass installed on the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| What most people see driving by is the exterior and no pavement on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| and that is in the works as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| They actually poured some of the concrete sidewalk this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| which will have to happen before they can start bringing their paving, preparing to install it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4196)|
| 1:10:04| Overall, based on the pay requests that we received on the 7th of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4204)|
| 1:10:13| they are approximately 84% complete overall or have drawn about 84% of their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| So we still have $1.8 million in the contract right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| I will tell you that their contract period ended on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| So as of the 19th, last Tuesday, we are assessing liquidated damages at $500 a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| until the project is deemed substantially complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| There will be even more work that will have to be done after substantial completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| and substantial completion definition is that we as the owner can move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| and start using the facility for its intended purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| There will be additional work on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| the old front entrance and driveway that will have to be taken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| and grade work done there, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| But this can happen after we start making use of the new portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| So are there any specific questions that you would like answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| I just wanted to get that update on TV so these guys can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| the two citizens could hear the completion date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| So hopefully that satisfies and we can get Pond Gap online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Right now their schedule is showing to be substantially complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| by the third week in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| So hopefully by then we'll have the pavement down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| and can actually start using the new portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| We're already in the classroom wing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| which is on the back side that you can't see from the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| but that was actually completed in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| moved the kids in and started using when they came back for second semester last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| So what's remaining now is the administrative office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| gymnasium, cafeteria, kitchen, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| So we're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4338)|
| 1:12:30| Discussion of items to be presented at the upcoming county legislative delegation and commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| That is on our agenda at the request of my fellow commissioners as I was seated as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| The meeting, I believe, is firmed up for Thursday, December the 7th, 11 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4365)|
| 1:12:56| The 11 to 12, that one hour, being dedicated to Knox County Commission's discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| with the local legislative delegation, an hour set aside for lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| and then the second hour, the 1 to 2, being dedicated to discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Board of Education with the state legislative delegation, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| Everyone of commission, Board of Education, the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| everyone is to be there the entire length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| It's just a dedication of one hour and one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| Aside from that, the topics of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| I would request that this item of discussion may be moved to your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| or to the vice chair, Commissioner Bussler's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| for the construction of the agenda that we would like to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| At this time, I do not have an item that I would raise for discussion at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Yes, we will have an October and a November meeting before we go to that December launching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| I would suggest that we discuss this again next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| come up with some ideas, and then finalize it at the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| I did speak with Representative Smith this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| and he said that they will have a better idea of what all is going to be introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| into legislation here in the next 30, 40 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| It would probably be a good idea for us to start thinking about what we want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| It may be a good idea to talk to Chris Caldwell and the mayor about things that they see possibly need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| But I guess we could have a discussion about this, start the discussion next month, if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4483)|
| 1:14:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Discussion regarding ethics committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Next month we will have to appoint two people to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| We need to have a public hearing before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| I am suggesting that we do it before our work session next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| Do it after the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Do it after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| We've got to appoint two people to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| After the work session as opposed to before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Before we're going to have a finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Do we have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| We'll set it for that and also to give people time that are employed that want to apply to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| So do we need to vote on that to set that or just say that that's what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| You can send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| We'll set it for after the work session meeting in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Are you saying 6 o'clock or immediately following?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4553)|
| 1:16:03| 6 o'clock or immediately following our work session in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| Is there a deadline that the applicants need to get the information into the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4570)|
| 1:16:23| You can take nominations from the floor if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| We've set it out and asked people to send stuff in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| If somebody turns around and wants somebody, you can nominate anybody that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| There's no limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4595)|
| 1:16:45| I'm looking at a memorandum that came from the law department and I am not seeing on it anywhere that there is a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4605)|
| 1:16:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Chairman, if you want to receive resumes, you can send that out publicly and have a deadline for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| or you can have it open for nominations on the night of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| It's however you want to conduct the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| Would you guys prefer to set a deadline that they have PM by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Discussion regarding rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| As I've expressed before, I was concerned about the billing process of AMR Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| I worked with my constituents since 2016 on their billing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| For the record, I am fully aware that this has been voted on with the affirmative vote of 7 to 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| to extend the contract for an additional five years in addition to the one year that was left on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| I felt the need for clarification in the language associated with the fee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4680)|
| 1:18:08| in order that Knox County is fully aware and understands the billing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| I made a motion to re-bid the contract based on my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| that any changes in the existing wording of the contract would require a re-bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| in order to avoid an appearance of bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| One example of this concern was the annual subscription fee of rural metro, now emergency care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| The contract states the $59 per household fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| The subscription I got, just received about a few days ago, says $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Now, I know that this is a minor increase of $16, but it is an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| In an earlier conversation, I mentioned the five-member board as stated in Statute 502 of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4732)|
| 1:19:00| It indicated the establishment of a five-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| The board's authority is limited to the approval or disapproval of any subsequent increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| in charges that the contractor proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| I was told prior to the meeting by a board member that there was no need to have the board made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| because there were no increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| I have never questioned the quality of service or the training of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| In fact, I have seen the ISO rating go down in many areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I have said and I have benefited from the improvement of the fire service on my own insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4775)|
| 1:19:43| Due to my continuing concern regarding the billing practice, I sent a letter to the law director, Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| on September 2nd, requesting clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| In the Monday night workshop, I read questions and the law director responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| I understand that there are still some concerns on the legal response that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| There is concern regarding the contractual language and fees and how the citizens of Knox County are being charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4806)|
| 1:20:18| As an elected official, I strongly believe every entity doing business with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4818)|
| 1:20:29| has not only a moral obligation but also a legal obligation to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| And that's why I brought it up again just to reinforce my opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| Again, I thank you all for this time and I think that's going to be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Commissioner Buster, can I just ask you one quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Because when I read the contract, I did see the caption that says that there's a five-member body that has to approve a rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| So what you're saying is in the contract it says $59 annual fee and now the fee is $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Yes, and I've got a contract that I just received not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| So in no body, there was no board established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| Was that for emergency transport or was that for the basic standard transport such as to take you to the doctor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4885)|
| 1:21:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| I see Mr. Myers heading our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| Okay, here is a basic contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| I have fire protection with them and I wanted to see how much more it would cost me for the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| And like I say, in the contract here, what we have from them, it says the basic service is $59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| These things were marked out and said because I have a basic question for that service because it's just me and my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| And it came to me with the $75 written in on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| And I've had this for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| Like I said, the only reason I'm bringing this up is I had concerns with the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| I also received another complaint today about someone was not at home and they received a service at their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4940)|
| 1:22:40| and they've received a bill for $1,450 for an ambulance service charged by, I don't know, I guess the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4960)|
| 1:22:49| for sending the first responder out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Again, I can't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| I'm not going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| I just had concerns for my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| I want people to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I'm upset that we have a contract and I don't know if it's being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| But from what I understand from the answers I got Monday night, I don't think it's being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4987)|
| 1:23:15| Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| So, anyway, that was just a point I was making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| The language in the contract about the medical review board, I believe, is what we're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| And I may have that a little bit off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| That board can only approve the rates that are being charged by rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5014)|
| 1:23:42| The reference to subscription is if I want to take it, that's up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| It's up to you all if you want to take the subscription services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| It's not mandated in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| So the medical review board will look at the $755, $745 charge plus the mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| That's what the review board will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| I have in my notes that they told us that it was $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| And I believe priorities is maybe $65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| But that was, they told us $75 when we were discussing it, that AMR charges for a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5062)|
| 1:24:32| They told us that at our meeting up front, that it's $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| Because I've gone back to my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| I have the contract with me if you want to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Let me get it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| Shoot, I've got it here someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| I think what Matt was alluding to is we don't regulate the contract for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5096)|
| 1:25:05| We regulate the cost of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5110)|
| 1:25:23| This is rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| It says 6.6 rates and charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Where have I got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| It's in there for 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| Right here it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Rural Metro proposes an ambulance membership subscription program as part of our response to this RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5137)|
| 1:25:45| Our emergency care program will have an annual fee of $59 per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| Details regarding this emergency care subscription agreement included in appendix 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5151)|
| 1:26:02| Appendix 23 is this right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| This is what was on the, and there's at that time that we have attached to this contract is $59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5170)|
| 1:26:20| It's not much, but it is an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| It says so in the contract here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Here's the rate structure right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Where the $75 came from, I just want to know who approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| I can't speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| I'm just stating what they told us it was, was $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| I mean, you know, it is volunteer to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Again, I was just going to say the intent of the Medical Review Board was to look at the ambulance rate charges that they charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| The subscription service is completely voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| You can take it if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| You don't have to take it if you don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| So can I ask the law department something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| So this right here that says on this right here, the subscription, and it says that's item 23, that means nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5229)|
| 1:27:20| That means, what he's saying is that means nothing right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5240)|
| 1:27:34| I think that this $59 per household is a set floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5254)|
| 1:27:47| And then when it refers to this, what do they call it, appendix 23, the attached document has on the back the definition of households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5267)|
| 1:28:00| And so making that assumption, I would say if you meet this definition of a household, because of this agreement here, it's $59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5280)|
| 1:28:09| But if you do not meet this definition of a household, then it could be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5289)|
| 1:28:18| I would say that's just what this contract looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| This is an addendum to this contract, which gives a little flexibility by defining what eligible persons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5303)|
| 1:28:32| If you meet this eligible person's definition, according to this, it would be $59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| But that would be on a per application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| It could be more, but the floor would be $59 if you meet that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| So if my family meets that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| It should be whatever, if it meets that definition, it should be $59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| I'd like to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| It went $16 is what the increase was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| And it doesn't seem like much, but if you have 1,000 or you had 10,000 subscribers, that's quite a bit of money that the contract is telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5348)|
| 1:29:18| This is how much you could charge for if you meet that standard household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| And again, I was just bringing it up that it was just not a spur of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| I've been working on this since 2016, the billing problems, and trying to get some of this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| And it was, I'm just saying they've got the contract for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5375)|
| 1:29:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Discussion regarding the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| At the next opportunity that the rules committee might have to meet, and I'm not calling for a meeting of the rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5394)|
| 1:30:02| but I would like to ask the rules committee to move the Pledge of Allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| and the devotional to the front of the agenda where it deservedly should be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5410)|
| 1:30:22| Looks like you guys have got a reason to meet now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Since I'm the chair, Mr. Law Director, do we have to have a rule change or can we do that just by a majority vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| The rule sets out the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| We'll get together and we'll have a rules committee meeting here pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| There may be other issues you may want to check with the law director's office to see some clarifications that may need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| Usually you all have to meet, what's that date, November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Once annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| And we usually do it by, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| We'll get together and give about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Everybody on the rules committee, those two, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| I'll get with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Is there anything else, any other announcements, anything anybody on commission would like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Mr. Holmes, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5474)|
| 1:31:23| I call to order this meeting of commission for zoning, September 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5483)|

| 1:31:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Before we get started, Dan Kelly would like to read a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| Commissioners, I put my mouth a couple months ago, and I think the only ethical thing in a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5520)|
| 1:32:09| and I think the only ethical thing would be to hear it out in another public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| So here goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| My name is Dan Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| I currently serve as deputy director of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| In my position, I've earned the privilege and trust to appear before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| to represent the recommendations of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| My service to Knox County dates back to when Charlie Maynard served as Knox County law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| During my career with MPC, I have developed and maintained good working relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| with all of the subsequent law directors and their staff attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| I do not want that to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| While appearing at this meeting a couple months ago, I overstepped my bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| I made a comment that I know offended Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Buch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| and many if not all of the members of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| At the July 24th County Commission meeting, Mr. Buch rendered an opinion that the growth plan had been effectively repealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5585)|
| 1:33:13| and therefore the commission was no longer bound to follow the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| A discussion of his legal opinion followed in which I misused the term competent legal authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| It was not my intent to imply or infer that Mr. Buch was incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| in the information that he provided to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| However, after reviewing the tape of the meeting, I can certainly see how my comment would be considered offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| As a result, I must offer an apology to the law department, specifically Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| and to Mr. Buch, and to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| Furthermore, please let it be known that the Law Director's Office has consistently provided me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| and other MPC staff members with sound legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| Additionally, they have provided us with strong legal defense in the courts when required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| I am grateful for the services their office provides to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| Additionally, the MPC staff and commission work hard to establish and maintain credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| with the citizens and elected officials of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| I don't want anyone to think that my GAF is endorsed or supported in any way by Mr. Green or the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5662)|
| 1:34:30| And finally, during my years with service to the county, I have developed a reputation as a straight shooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5670)|
| 1:34:41| a person who says what he means and means what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| On that particular night, I did neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| Please accept my apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Commissioner Wright, unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Thank you again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Mr. Chairman, sort of a carryover from sitting as the Chair of Zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| I would like to, I know we normally do not have discussion items at zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| but if we have time after the meeting, I need to discuss with commission a couple of returned certified letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5711)|
| 1:35:21| Yes, I'm aware of what you're speaking to, and that's definitely something we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5728)|

| 1:37:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Next item, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Request of Joyce Webb for rezoning from T Transition and F Floodway to OB Office Medical and Related Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5881)|
| 1:38:08| and F Floodway property located northwest side of Ebenezer Road, northeast of South Peters Road, Commission District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| Yes, I'm Jared Garceau, PO Box 2425 Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| This rezoning request is connected to the ordinance amendment regarding supportive housing that's set to come up later on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5906)|
| 1:38:35| And we would like to request a deferral for 30 days so the ordinance amendment can be addressed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| That was kind of the reason that the commission deferred this rezoning request in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| was to allow an ordinance amendment regarding supportive housing to be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| So just we'd like to continue it until that takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| I'll make a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Could it not be moved to the heel of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| It could, but I believe they're requesting a 30-day deferral if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| What Commissioner Wright is saying is we could move this until after we hear the ordinance if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| Would you rather have 30 days to look it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5967)|
| 1:39:36| A motion to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=5982)|

| 1:40:09| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, here on behalf of the applicant and appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| Do you all have anyone to speak for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6024)|

| 1:40:39| I just wanted to say if any of you are out here that left me phone messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| I could not return your call, I could not speak, but I listened to your messages and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6048)|
| 1:40:57| The report of the MP staff, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6057)|
| 1:41:05| Commissioners, the Planning Commission recommends denial of the sector plan amendment from BPTO to MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6065)|
| 1:41:15| In addition to that, they recommended denial of the rezoning from BP to O.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6075)|
| 1:41:23| The vote on that matter was 14 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| If I may, I may spread out my time a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| What we are here tonight to do is to ask you to send this matter back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6096)|
| 1:41:46| with the request that it consider a sector plan amendment from the present sector plan to medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6106)|
| 1:42:01| and that the zoning follow accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| This property has some history connected with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| The present owners purchased it in 1976 before the Pellissippi Parkway was opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6130)|
| 1:42:18| At that time, the property was zoned planned residential at up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6138)|
| 1:42:26| Sometime in the 80s when the scientific corridor and technology overlay came into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6146)|
| 1:42:33| this property was rezoned from planned residential to BP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| Mr. Paul Fane is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| He represents the owner's group, and they have been unable to market this property since 1983| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6161)|
| 1:42:54| for the intended or to make it compliant with the business professional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| In the meantime, I know there have been questions about the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| I think Mr. VanDeVate has some comments that I would like to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6186)|
| 1:43:14| and I assume the commission would like to hear about plans for road improvements in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| But the property originally was zoned planned residential, and that's what we're asking for it to go back to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6200)|
| 1:43:30| And that would require that you all recommend it go back to MPC for a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| for medium density residential and consideration of planned residential at an appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| And that would simply take the property back to where it was in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| If I may, I'd like to have Mr. Fane speak on behalf of the ownership group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| on the reasons they have been unable to market the property under its current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6234)|
| 1:44:04| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| My name is Paul Fane, 12524 Amberset, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| I am a co-owner in the property with approximately 20 other partners and their families, many elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| and they can't be here, so I'm here as the representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| A handful are out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Since this parcel was originally as purchased zoned for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6261)|
| 1:44:30| we bought it as an investment for sale and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| It's been 35 years in the technology corridor, and we've had two zone-appropriate contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6275)|
| 1:44:44| One was from Kimberly Clark back in 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| They did their site study and said this property won't work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| They relocated to Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| The other was the Development Corporation of Knox County in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| They surveyed the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| They did their site study and decided this property is not appropriate for their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Now, we've had multiple residential contracts over the last 15 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| but they've been discouraged and withdrawn based on issues such as these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| So we're asking for support from Mr. Biddle as a purchaser of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| and potential developer to give it residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| It's my understanding that the I-40-Pellissippi interchange is almost the epicenter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| of the greater metropolitan Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| It's accessible to UT and downtown, to Oak Ridge, to Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| and to all that West Knoxville has to offer, great schools, shopping amenities, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| Folks want to live up here in single-family and multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| We're asking for the opportunity to participate in what the market is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| Now, we've been supporters of the Tech Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| We've been supporters of the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| We have sold dozens and dozens of acres, our property owner groups, to the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| In fact, we sold them the land in Centerpoint Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| They've got parcels available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| We sold them most of the land in Pellissippi Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| They've got over 70 acres available, thereabouts, six, seven parcels, 60, 70 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| right across Coward Mill from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| They have roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| They have utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| They have pricing flexibility to perhaps sell under market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| We can't compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| So we're asking for the opportunity to sell and have this property developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| and let other people enjoy Hardin Valley and West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| I may point out one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| This property has been reviewed by two bodies before it came up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| Mr. Kelly talked about what the Metropolitan Planning Commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| There's also another body that is charged with reviewing property in the Pellissippi Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| and that is the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| We had two hearings before that body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| and they are charged with looking at the whole technology corridor out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6426)|
| 1:47:14| We had two hearings before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| After the first hearing, they made no decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| but they wanted to hear from Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| and investigate further before they made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| We went back to that body a second time for their final decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| and had further discussion with that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| And they unanimously recommended planned residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| And they oversee the development of all of the property in the Pellissippi Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| And I think their recommendation should be given a lot of weight in your consideration here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6469)|
| 1:48:00| because that is all they specialize in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| They've been in existence since the, Kelly, since the 90s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| And it's a body of professionals that include commissioners, architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| and engineers who have specialized knowledge about the Tech Corridor Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6498)|
| 1:48:26| Now, I know there is opposition based upon the road condition out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| Coward Mill is not, I'm not going to argue it's an adequate road for a subdivision at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6511)|
| 1:48:39| However, the whole corridor has issues with traffic, and I think Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6519)|
| 1:48:47| they've done some studies out there in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| but I think it would be informative to hear from them what their plans are for the future in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| because there are certainly road issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Someone from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| I had their time right at nine minutes, so we'll give you equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| My name is Debra Pettit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| I live at 10451 Laurel Point Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| I am president of the Magnolia Point Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| but I'm also the spokesperson for four subdivisions and many individuals that live along Coward Mill and Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6566)|
| 1:49:34| We are here because Mr. Biddle is appealing the decision of the MPC on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| Just last year, in August of 2016, the MPC and this commission reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| and updated the Northwest County Sector Plan and did not propose any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| We don't understand what has happened that some may be considering altering this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| Our main concern with this proposal is the estimated traffic impact in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| and the hazardous traffic situations it will create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| Now, Mr. Biddle at one time was proposing 405 apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| which meant over 3,000 car trips daily according to your own transportation department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| Now, there are two drawings in his recent appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| One has 190 apartments and the other one has over 100 homes on the 33.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6627)|
| 1:50:35| We are unsure what his intentions are and what the final outcome will be with this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| No matter what is built, entering and exiting this property is a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| With no access to Pellissippi, and that's our understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| that there will be no other access road that goes out to Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| this means that Coward Mill will receive all the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| Some mention the Cherahala Boulevard, the extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| but that will be very expensive, which we understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| and it is not in the planning stages as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| We are fearful that Mr. Biddle will be successful with this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| and not be able to overbuild this track of land without much supervision or oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6677)|
| 1:51:24| Then all of us who live in the area are left to deal with this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| and this one deal will have long-lasting effects upon the way of life of over 250 families that live in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| We understand that the Hardin Valley is a very popular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| and it's quite desirable, and we know that growth is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| But with that, we need people with vision to understand that roads and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| need to be a priority before any more development begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| This is our main concern and why so many of us are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| We don't want rezoning first and then address the traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| Coward Mill Road cannot handle the increase of traffic on this narrow, curvy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| At certain times of the day, there is a backup on Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| attempting to go out on Pellissippi Parkway, which is very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Cars are trying to cross over, and then there are cars doing U-turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| trying to avoid the congestion on the ramp to Hardin Valley for the college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Now, just this morning, I was leaving at quarter to eight, approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| and went to Coward Mill to cross over, down Coward Mill to cross over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| and there were eight cars waiting to cross over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Sometimes there's as many as 12 cars, and that's just with the local traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| It took me over 10 minutes to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| and part of the reason is that the kids that are going to the college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| there is such a backup getting off Pellissippi onto Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| that it was backed up, when I finally arrived at that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| it was backed up from Hardin Valley halfway back to Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| and someone else that came around 8 o'clock said it was backed up all the way to Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| So that means those cars were all in one lane waiting to get off at the Hardin Valley exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| So with the increase of traffic, no matter how many homes or apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| that they put in that location, which they said could be up to 3,000 car trips a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| even another 100 cars going that way would be, the traffic would be unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| So, let's go down Coward, Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| It's not much of an improvement because of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| You'd go down Hardin, Reagan Road, turn right to get on Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| and try to get in line to get on to Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Again, that gets very congested in the morning and on the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| Another unknown is the extra traffic that will be generated by the new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| that's coming from Oak Ridge Highway to the Garrison Drive intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| So we know some people will turn left, but if they turn right and go down Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| that will increase the traffic in that area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| But we know that Hardin Valley is an area that should be built upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| but we have to have some vision and the infrastructure and the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| have to be there before any development begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| We ask you to vote no on this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| Thank you for listening to all of our voices and our phone calls and our e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| And we thank you for all the time that you spend on matters like these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| If we could, I guess Dwight and that group have stayed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| And also it's come to light over the last few days that the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| hasn't been a part of this conversation yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| So that will kind of play in our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| But, Dwight, if you could come down and speak to what the discussion has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| I know we've talked about Cherry Halor for numerous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| but some things have changed up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| And so I want to hear what you're all's input is on the potential for the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| and what it, and I know we don't know what it looks like yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| because we haven't had that conversation with Todd yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| So if you'll expound on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| Thank you, Commissioner Anders, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Commissioner Dwight VandeVeet, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| I do appreciate the chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| We want to make sure that we leave this commission with a clear record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| And I think it's important to stipulate that our project that we will propose to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| in the upcoming budget cycle is unrelated to this or any other development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| So I just would like to enter that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| Obviously, it has become a part of this conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| We're comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| But had this conversation never taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| this same proposal is coming to you in the upcoming budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| So we do want to make sure the record is clear there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Our project is not driven by any of the development considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| that you're going to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| It's driven principally by two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| First is I'd ask you to consider that stretch of Pellissippi Parkway in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| Between the interstate and the county line in Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| it is a facility that really has an identity crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| It is a four-lane, median-divided facility with interstate speeds that has multiple at-grade crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| That is not what originally was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| and it does not function the way that it should from the standpoint of safety and accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| The Tennessee Department of Transportation is hard at work to remedy this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| and we want to be a part of that solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| And so one of the things that drives the project that we're going to bring you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| is that it will create access to Pellissippi Parkway at the same time that it closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| multiple at-grade intersections on a facility where at-grade intersections should not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Two, this will come as no surprise to any member of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| but particularly Commissioner Andrews and Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| We have our hands full in the northwest county sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| and we have our hands full in Heartland Valley in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| and we see this facility that we're going to propose to you in the upcoming budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| as an important part or one in a series of steps that's going to help alleviate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| But we are unrelated to any of the development proposals that might be at issue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| We don't have any criticism of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| We're not advocates for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| They're just not relevant to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| From our standpoint, we're here to talk about transportation facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| and again, our proposal is going to come to you in the upcoming budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| irrespective of anything else that might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| It should be noted, I think maybe Commissioner Andrews mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| our plans are very, very preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| I think Drusilla did send you some sketches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| and I just remind you if you looked at those that you actually saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| those are sketches with a felt tip pen on a couple of rough plan sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| So we don't yet know exactly what we're going to propose to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| It is certainly possible the alignment of this facility will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| but it will be in the budget proposal that we're going to bring you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| The staff has been hard at work on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| but this discussion popped up at a time when we, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| weren't really ready to answer questions either for the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| or for Mr. Biddle with a specificity that either of them would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| But again, as I've told both of them, right now the conditions we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| are two sections of property that are separated largely by a pasture field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| and we're going to make a proposal that's based on transportation facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| and how we can most efficiently and effectively move people in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| Beyond that, I brought pretty much every member of the transportation planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| Jim Snowden, our chief engineer, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Cindy is here as well, our director of planning and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| I brought our newest staff engineer, Aaron Fritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| He's a staff transportation engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| He's doing some good work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| We're hard at work at this, and we'll have something to you in the budget proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| but I can't tell you exactly yet what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| I don't know if that helps, but that's the snapshot from where we sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| After he's done, I don't have any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| I just want to talk to Todd if Todd wants to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7180)|
| 1:59:54| Todd Napier, Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| Thanks for that 430 phone call there Friday afternoon, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| I guess what, I don't know who else has gotten the phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| but there's a discussion that we're asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| We're going to have this discussion about this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| that potentially really should lie within what this road project looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| Todd has not been, to my knowledge, has no communication from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| Some of the property that the proposed felt tip pen sketches were on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| property we no longer own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Todd, do you want to make a statement or jump in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| I guess I would say we, myself, members of TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7239)|
| 2:00:47| Knox County Engineering, Paul Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| have talked about access to this property for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| As that property was zoned BP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| we talked about understanding about whether or not, how viable was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| I've always felt like until there was a solution to the access, it was not likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| So one of the things I had said that I felt like that, in all fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| in the best interest of Knox County as we looked about moving forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| presenting property in Pell City Corporate Center to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| to make sure that we didn't do anything that would prevent the extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| Chair Hale Boulevard directly to the north out of the cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| straight down to Carradine Mill and across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| In fact, there had been some plans laid out for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| but there was never a significant plan other than that or money on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| But I have stuck to my word on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| I was aware that there was some rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| but really have chosen for the most part not to get specifically involved in a lot of the rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| leaving that to the Planning Commission and to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| because I know what it's like to be on the other side of that, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| But I did have a conversation with Jim Snowden on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| and it was late before he and I were able to finally connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| about that this was coming up pretty quickly to you all on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| and that one of the potential considerations was a very different alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| than was ever considered, which would take out one of our development lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| plus the corner of one that we don't even own anymore that we've recently sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| And on top of that, really, in all fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| I don't have a vote on Development Corporation land sales matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| I have recommendations, and my board hadn't considered this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| So if the zoning appeal that was going to be considered today or tonight's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| was based on the expectation or the anticipation that this road was going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| I think it was premature, because at least those conversations need to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| with the Development Corporation board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| So if the appeal stands on its own merit based on what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| I'm not going to take a position on that, but I certainly would take a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| if it's contingent upon Development Corporation contribution of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| and I'm not saying that that can't or won't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| but I'm just saying that discussion at least needs to be had and the pros and cons weighed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| So, I mean, that's pretty much the extent about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| I think we've all recognized that access to this property as well as the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| and everything north of there on this side is, for all the reasons Dwight talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| and others, needs to be resolved, and it sounds like they're going to be working very hard on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| and coming up with the best engineering solution by the next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7428)|
| 2:03:57| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| Mr. Dapier, Mr. Fain said that in 1999 that you offered or looked at this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| I mean, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| I wasn't there at that time, but I do know the time I've had those discussions with Paul Fain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7450)|
| 2:04:19| the property has been of a size plus the understanding of the likely construction cost to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| that it doesn't make it a very appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| I think it's like 34, 35 acres today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| It may have been a little larger, and if you're $4 or $5 million to build a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| that's on a per acre basis pretty steep just to get to it plus everything else you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| There are better options for us to invest money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| Now, if a road was to be built for other reasons other than access for our purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| then those numbers might change, but from a pure development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| making that kind of investment just to access property, the numbers don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| Is this, in your opinion, is this a good partial for a technology business building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7499)|
| 2:05:08| With proper access, I believe it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| There's a difference between development corporation property and private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| Development corporation property is in the real estate business for the purposes of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| We look at jobs, investment per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| If you're going to relocate, how many new jobs are you creating and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| So there are projects that just because of what we are trying to do and the nature of organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| that we might not fit within one of our business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| but yet I also advocate there needs to be property out there for quote free market kind of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| that really don't qualify any places to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| So under those dynamics, if it had proper access, would it have already sold by now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| I mean, there's been questions about, you know, development corporation still has property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| So, you know, I'm charged with promoting business and economic development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7558)|
| 2:06:06| So I would say, yeah, we could always use more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| Is that the best use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| I guess I'll leave that decision to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| I guess Mr. Fein is correct with an F, F-A-I-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7578)|
| 2:06:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| Your investment group bought this property in the 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| and it says that one of your emails or letters says that you were forced into this zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| Is that what really happened or was it already zoned for technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| and it was just an investment hoping that you all would turn a profit and there's nothing wrong with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| We, I'm quoting out of archive records that go back to my predecessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| which was my late father Kemp, who died in 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| So that's phraseology that I can't confirm or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| But that's where that comes from, that the property originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| when it was purchased in 76, was PR, planned residential, up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| And then eight years later, when the technology quarter came into being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| there's probably somebody in the room that knows better than I do how the landowners agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| or were told what to do, but it became SP, scientific production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| And everybody was on board, it's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| It's not played out exactly that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| And market forces, you know, have been moving in a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| in the Hard Valley, Pell City Parkway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| Mr. Kelly, can you answer that question? Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| You're wanting a history lesson on the technology quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| Well, I heard that the land was bought in the 70s and the technology quarter didn't come in until 83,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| so that leads to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| What Mr. Fain said was correct in that the tech quarter, the rezonings were done in 82, 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7679)|
| 2:08:09| The properties were zoned from various zones to BP, and the technology overlay zone was also applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7689)|
| 2:08:17| The BP zone is what controls the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| The technology overlay zone has the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| Over the years, and the technology quarter used to be a lot wider than it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| it used to go out quite a distance from the parkway, and through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7709)|
| 2:08:37| the BP zoning has been reduced now to where, I'm not going to say it's just the frontage parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| but there is a whole lot less BP type zoning now than there was when the quarter first came into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7724)|
| 2:08:52| It was a program that was endorsed by the county commission at that time because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7732)|
| 2:09:00| and I think it was a reaction to, or what I've always heard was it was a reaction to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7740)|
| 2:09:08| we don't want another Kingston park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| There were concerns that the parkway would develop as a strip commercial development out the parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7751)|
| 2:09:20| and that's why the program of the technology quarter, if you also remember at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7760)|
| 2:09:29| over in Raleigh in that area, the triangle over there, and then Silicon Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7769)|
| 2:09:36| that's when all that stuff was coming online back in the 80s too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| Why can't we have that too, considering we have Oak Ridge, University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| and all these other facilities around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| That's how the technology quarter came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| My question to you, for us to go by the guidelines to change the sector plan, there has to be a major improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| Just because Knox County Engineering says that next year they're going to present a budget for the new road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| that is not a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| That's not happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| If we do decide to rezone, change the sector plan and send it back to look at the dwelling units per acre and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7814)|
| 2:10:22| I will have a problem with dirt being turned before there's a road being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| So my question to you was back to the first statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| What has changed that can lead me to know that one of these conditions at the sector plan has changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7832)|
| 2:10:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| If I may, and also Ms. Waddell is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| Her father was one of the original owners on the property, David Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7845)|
| 2:10:53| The major change has been nothing has happened with the BP on this property for 35 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7853)|
| 2:11:00| Second is there is a tremendous demand for residential property in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| Part of that, or I'd say most of it, I can lay at county commission and the Board of Education's feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| because you all have created a school system out there where you can go from K-1 through 12th grade in the Hardin Valley schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7873)|
| 2:11:24| which are essentially almost on the same campus there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| That wasn't even envisioned until this century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| And now Hardin Valley Middle School is under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| I'm not sure. Will it be open next fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| The next thing, and you all heard about this earlier today from Marilyn Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| Pellissippi State has become a major educational institution in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| It was a very small campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| I can't remember when it was first built out there, but it was always a very small campus until recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| And with the state's initiatives on education, that is changing dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| So there's a tremendous demand for residential property in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| and no demand at this time for BP involving this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7933)|
| 2:12:20| Mr. Napier can correct me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| That's the Pellissippi Center just to the south of this, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7944)|
| 2:12:33| Pellissippi Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| And I think they still have quite a bit of property in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| I can't remember how many acres, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| Seventy-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| Seventy-five acres available for sale in that one corporate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| And as Mr. Napier said, their mission for Knox County, the Development Corporation's initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7968)|
| 2:12:55| is to bring good business, industry, and jobs to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| and not to make money from the sale of residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| which our investment group is desiring to do and has been since 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7985)|
| 2:13:15| So it's my understanding that county commission and school board is the reason for the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=7995)|
| 2:13:23| That's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| The others I mentioned, too, the state of Tennessee, Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| I didn't realize it until Ms. Roddy spoke at the first of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| that Pellissippi is the biggest community college in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| I think she said that when she spoke at the beginning of your five o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8017)|
| 2:13:44| Those are conditions that did not exist when the BP zoning ended up on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8024)|
| 2:13:52| I'll agree with you on the demand for residential is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| That could be a reason for the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| I'd like to talk to Mr. Biddle if he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| Please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| It's Rusty Biddle, 10784 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| We've got, I heard, 400 apartments, 100 homes, and 190 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8055)|
| 2:14:22| Are you willing to tell us what you plan to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| At this point in time, you don't have to if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| I have never proposed 400 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| I think simple math was done with the OB zoning and 12 units per acre is where that number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8071)|
| 2:14:37| I've originally done two concept plans, both I think which you guys have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| Both of those were given to MPC originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| I don't think they were shared throughout the community, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| But those are the two initial plans that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| My apartment, my potential apartment, gentleman has backed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| So at this point, we're looking at strictly single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| And I think the plan you have there is right at a little over three, between three and four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| And that is our intent at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| That's our only intent at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| Well, three and four is not bad at all as far as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| So you're looking at four, you're looking at 1,200, is it 10 times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| 1,200, around 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| I think that's some of the numbers that are used, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| Yeah, about 1,200 trips a day, which is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| But I still have a concern with, you know, if this is approved tonight and sent back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| for review and the number of dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| that turning the dirt before this commission approves a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| And Mr. Seymour has already accused the commissions of we're pretty good about approving developments with no road access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8137)|
| 2:15:45| and then all these roads are too narrow to handle and then we get blamed because we do approve this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8145)|
| 2:15:53| and the roads are too narrow and too dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| So I guess my question, have you got a timeline that you may look at doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| To be honest, at this point, if we go back to MPC, we will come back to you guys again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| We will again have to go back to MPC for a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Then we have engineering, review of engineering with the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| So, I mean, we're probably in the March, April time frame, maybe June, before we could get engineering approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| At that point, we're probably a full year out with construction of pushing dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| That's typical for a project this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| And I would dare say our Knox County engineering department, we're a year out on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| and probably a year out before the construction starts and then a year of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| So we're maybe looking at three years, you know, before the road, hopefully before a new road could be added into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8200)|
| 2:16:48| So I heard Mr. Napier say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that he's not really for it and he's not really against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8208)|
| 2:16:56| Nod your head yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| So that leads me to believe that, you know, me personally, three to four units an acre is not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| And there is a demand for residential, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| And so I thank Mr. Seymour for explaining, you know, the sector plan and what has changed out of these five criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8227)|
| 2:17:17| that we've got to look at to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| So thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| If I could say one more thing as far as ingress and egress to the property, we do have a tertiary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| which to me would be the primary on the inbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| There was an agreement made with TDOT several years ago, and I'm not sure how it went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| We can't seem to find the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| But Faith Promise Church and this property shares the road that goes into Faith Promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| So as you go into Faith Promise Church, there will be a connector road that comes back into my development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| So I would have to say 90%, 95% of your inbound traffic would use that route to get in and get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| As well, they would have access back down to the lower access to go towards Oak Ridge, which would alleviate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8273)|
| 2:18:00| I would think, a significant amount of your Oak Ridge traffic, people that are going to Oak Ridge, if that makes sense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| Can I clarify one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| Mr. VandeVeet, when we close that road down, we're going to do access closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8290)|
| 2:18:17| and so we will have on-ramps and bridges at this new entrance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| At Hardin Valley and down, I don't know what the name of the next road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| It would be in partnership with the Tennessee Department of Transportation, because Pellissippi Parkway is their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| But the conventional 90-degree at-grade intersections would go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| and they would be replaced with probably slip ramps that are more appropriate for the speeds that Pellissippi Parkway operates at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| Commissioner Brownlee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| You know, as a life, or half of my life, lived in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| and I've been screaming roads ever since I got on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| because I can say this to the residents of Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| if you double that road, it won't make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| There's way too many people, way too many cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| It's not going to make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| I sat on the Tennessee Technology Authority ever since I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| and we meet to try to get technology-type businesses in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| But there's no demand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| The demand is for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| That's what people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| People want to live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| And they'll come from all over to live in that area, and that's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| You can zone it any way you want to, but there's no businesses that are going to build on property that's not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| And one of the reasons they don't build on that property in particular is because of the road on Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| Not so much Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| They'll drive a trailer truck down a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8390)|
| 2:19:53| It's the entrance and exit from Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| The same problem that you have at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| That's why the kids are backing up all the way to Lovell Road to go to school in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| And then they pull out and get hit doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| So that's the problem, but that's TDOT's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| And until TDOT addresses that, which the only thing they have that I can find that they have planned are ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8412)|
| 2:20:19| They have a ramp plan going toward Oak Ridge, what they're working on now, and they're doing a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| What's the name of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Schaefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8427)|
| 2:20:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| And they're redoing the road off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| But that's it so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| So they say they don't have the money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| Until something like that happens, we're going to keep doing this, but that's not going to stop people from building houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| So to me, this is not that big of a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| I don't think it's going to adversely affect the neighborhood as much as you think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| Because it's already adversely affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| And there's nothing you can do to stop that because this has been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| I mean, it lines up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| Going to the schools on Hard Valley Road lines up three or four miles sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| It's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| You know, we feel the grief, but I don't know what to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| I don't know that stopping this particular project of just single family housing is going to help your problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8476)|
| 2:21:23| because the problem is much bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| Commissioner Nostrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| I've got, I guess, a follow-up question for Dwight from one of the questions that Commissioner Daley had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8492)|
| 2:21:41| Dwight, you need to sit on the front, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| We're making you walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| It's his wellness plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| Dwight, this is kind of an engineering question for the non-engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| We had talked about the potential for us to pass this and to get it rolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| and I realize that these two items are not connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| However, one of the easy, simple questions is, if that's approved in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8522)|
| 2:22:09| how long does it usually take for a construction project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| Because I have seen the felt tip drawings in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| and it appears as if there's going to be connections directly into Pellissippi and all this sort of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| which may be tied into TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| But based on your ballpark figure and my idea of ballpark and engineering and roads is probably a six-month window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8542)|
| 2:22:28| how long do projects like this take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| Commissioner Nystrom, one, I should let the record reflect that in these questions I typically rely on Jim's expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8554)|
| 2:22:40| but we actually were discussing that today in the office, so I can shed a little light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8560)|
| 2:22:46| Time to construct would probably be about 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| Now, that's construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| That does not include time for design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| So if this commission approved it on July 1st of 2018 and we got through design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8573)|
| 2:23:02| and any environmental that we had, we might start construction in the spring of 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| and finish late calendar year 19 or early 2020, depending on weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8589)|
| 2:23:16| And I actually wouldn't mind if, Jimmy, you either give me a nod or come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8596)|
| 2:23:25| I'm going to take that as I wasn't too far off, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| You can come right back, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| It's part of his wellness plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| He's getting his steps in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| He sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| They do have my Fitbit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| So are some of us to believe that if this is proposed in the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| and public works budget for this next May of this next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| that this project would go to the top of the capital plans list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| and this would preempt any other construction projects that are ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| or on the drawing board for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| Because if that's the case, something's dead wrong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| No, fair question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| That is more of a finance question than an engineering question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| In terms of the scope of the project, could we manage it contemporaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| with the other work that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| Yes, sir, I think that we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| Our priority, as this commission knows, is going to be the ball camp gourd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| or shod road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| The other will be Canton Hollow in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| So I don't think this project is so large that we couldn't manage it from a standpoint of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8673)|
| 2:24:40| and construction and move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| Whether or not Mr. Caldwell could support it from a debt service plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| and the capital plan is a question above my pay grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| and I'm just not able to shed any light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| Would you estimate a cost for this type project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| $45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| So that's two-thirds of the cost of the Canton Hollow Road project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| Sounds about right, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| We do take note of the fact that the original proposal on some of the drawings that you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| showed a boulevard alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| We intend to probably just do a three-lane alignment with no boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| So I would say closer to the $4 million mark, but it's almost a mile of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8721)|
| 2:25:28| It's a substantial project, so give or take around $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| This is a project that you have not discussed with administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| as far as where potential funding will come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| We have asked the mayor if he would support it if we incorporated it into our upcoming capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| and we've also discussed with him fairly extensively our concerns about Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| As I've told this commission speaking to a group a few months ago and asked what keeps me awake at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| my answer was Hardin Valley, and this is part of that larger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| I have not discussed it with finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| The capital list that Commissioner Schoonmaker refers to, that is usually a safety audit, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8774)|
| 2:26:20| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| We work off the strategic transportation plan, and that's what is driving the Canton Hollow Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| The ball camp corridor project goes back to a master road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| that was developed when Bill Kerbin was superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| It was shelved at one time, and it came back when the Beltway project went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| Remember that the Shod Road project is to provide mobility, and the Canton Hollow Road project is for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8801)|
| 2:26:55| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| I wouldn't go too far, do I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| In your opening statement, you said that you would wish for us to send this back at medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8824)|
| 2:27:13| Yet in Mr. Biddle's statement, he gave testimony that four units an acre is what his current concept is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8833)|
| 2:27:24| I contradicted him, or he contradicted me, and I'm going to let Mr. Biddle invite him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| Do we want low density or medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| I think he wants six units per acre, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| I guess I would love to leave the option open if the road was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| In one of the comments I had made today, could I have four units per acre if the road is constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| and my current plans were to fall through, could I have up to six units per acre upon road approval, funding, etc.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8869)|
| 2:27:57| I think MDR in the county is up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8877)|
| 2:28:02| LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| I mean LDR is up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8883)|
| 2:28:13| Low density residential is up to five units per acre in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8893)|
| 2:28:19| If you go five or above, it's MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8899)|
| 2:28:26| Dwight, I do have one last question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8906)|
| 2:28:37| Dwight, alleviation of traffic problems in Hardin Valley ranks where in the county's priority of roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8917)|
| 2:28:47| I'm not sure I understand the question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| If we wanted to know where specific roads in the area fell on the strategic transportation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| I'm not sure any of us could call that from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| In terms of congestion and delay and in terms of constituent complaints, at this point it's really far and away at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8940)|
| 2:29:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| Mr. Dwight, you're the hero of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| It's a scary place, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| Personally, I guess I have a problem that the county is trying to look at a $4 million road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8966)|
| 2:29:35| to satisfy the development needs of one property owner to develop their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8975)|
| 2:29:41| When you look around the county at how many roads need to be repaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| how many intersections need to be improved in all of our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| and to think that we would just kind of jump around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| and then all of a sudden throw something on your budget for next year, a $4 million expenditure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| to basically serve one small property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| And even if you took out half the homes, you're still looking at 1,500 trips a day emptying into Pellissippi Parkway from Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9009)|
| 2:30:21| I just don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| I probably haven't done as good a job articulating our interest here, Commissioner, as I should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| But again, the presence of at-grade intersections on a four-lane, median-divided facility with interstate speeds is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9030)|
| 2:30:38| It just is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| This discussion, one of those plan sheets that was circulated to Commission is several years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9041)|
| 2:30:48| Our discussions internally have gone back several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| And again, if Mr. Biddle wins the Powerball on Wednesday and abandons this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9051)|
| 2:31:00| and Mr. Napier retires and neither one of them has any further interest in anything out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9060)|
| 2:31:05| we're bringing you this project in the capital plan in July and hoping that you'll consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| We want to close those at-grade intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| We want to, frankly, try to create conditions where Faith Promise is no longer doing the rolling roadblocks on Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9074)|
| 2:31:23| when they discharge services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| That is an unsafe condition and problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| This gives us an opportunity to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| So I wouldn't want to leave this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| Again, I don't mean to pick on Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| I don't take issue with what he proposes, but I'm certainly not an advocate for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| Our project is coming to you regardless of what happens with any of the development considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9099)|
| 2:31:45| And further projects, I hope, depending on funding in Hardin Valley, will be coming to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| Cindy has been in discussions with Jeff Welch, the TPO, about a corridor study for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| I've got $100,000 in the budget this year for preliminary solutions to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| just to get the discussion started on what we're going to do as far, potentially, as going west on Hardin Valley, out Hickory Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9121)|
| 2:32:10| and eventually to come out, potentially, around Buttermilk or Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| Obviously, it's very much on our mind, and this is certainly just a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| So I wouldn't want you to think this is a development-driven project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| either on behalf of Mr. Biddle or the Development Corporation or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| We're bringing you this project in our capital plan submission, and we hope we'll make a good case for it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9148)|
| 2:32:37| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| We're talking about a project that we won't be able to vote on or see or anything like this until next July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9161)|
| 2:32:50| and we're talking about the improvement of the road to be connected with a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9170)|
| 2:32:57| And as long as I've been serving on MPC back in the 90s and to this project we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9177)|
| 2:33:06| I understand that road projects are normally done by necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9186)|
| 2:33:13| We don't build for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| We react instead of be proactive, and we've got a problem out there that we've got to react to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| That's the big thing about the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| Are we voting on it for the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| Are we voting on the road saying that it's going to be improved, like Dwight said, for safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| I think that's the reason you've got it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| Is what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| Just wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| You don't have to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| Maybe I should have had him come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| But anyway, what I mean by saying that is it's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9222)|
| 2:33:49| The road's going to have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| If that has to do with connection of making the property go forward from what we're doing right now or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| that's not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| As Dwight said, they're looking at it as a safety issue, not a development issue for the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9239)|
| 2:34:06| And, Mr. Biddle, I'm not talking against your project, but I think that's what Dwight was speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| Anyway, what do we need to do to bring this to a conclusion and vote one way or the other is the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9254)|
| 2:34:23| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| I think the connector road is designed to relieve Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| It has nothing to do with Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| It's designed to relieve the traffic on Hardin Valley, which is going to put more traffic on Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| And that's the whole scheme of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| What you folks are sitting in is what I sat in 32 years ago, a nice community, country setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9287)|
| 2:34:54| It's not going to be there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9296)|
| 2:34:57| It's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| You can widen Coward Mill to four lanes and it's still going to be a horrible mess of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| That's the way that community has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| And it's TDOT's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| They built an incorrect intersection at Hardin Valley Road and they can't correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9308)|
| 2:35:16| And so now we have this backup that's just going to keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| So this road is relief, really, from Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| So if you get a new Coward Mill road, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| It'll be good for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| So it'll get you down to Pellissippi so you get in line quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| That's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| You'll just get in line quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| It's not going to relieve the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Pellissippi is backed up every day and you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| Where is that traffic going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| Is it going to turn on Coward Mill and do a short cut down to West Valley to get over to Oak Ridge Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| That's the problem with the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| And I don't think it's Mr. Biddle's problem just because he wants to build a small subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9352)|
| 2:35:58| To me, what he's going to do would be like taking a bucket of water and throwing it in a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| That's about the effect that it's going to have on traffic in that area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| It's not going to make much difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| It's bad already and it's just going to stay bad until something big happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| Well, I think that, you know, we've all had this discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| I've told the residents that I've spoken to and I've told Mr. Biddle and Mr. Seymour that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9385)|
| 2:36:32| I think without Chair Hala that Coward Mill can't withstand a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9392)|
| 2:36:37| Chair Hala was being discussed prior to me coming on commission in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9397)|
| 2:36:42| It's not a new discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| It's not a new road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| It's just a everybody is ready to fix, to attempt to fix, relieve, whatever you want to call Hardin Valley and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9406)|
| 2:36:55| Carnes Connector is a help for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| It's all about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| And I'm going to make a motion to send it back, but it doesn't, and Mr. Biddle, I'm not going to surprise him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| He's not going to have a shocked look on his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| But it doesn't say that I support the project moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| There's been a change in his plan and I think that, to be fair, it's okay for MPC to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9432)|
| 2:37:19| But I'm not, it doesn't indicate the next time he comes here I approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9439)|
| 2:37:24| I think Mr. Kelly is about to, you need to speak before I make a motion, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| Well, you're going to initiate commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| The vote is going to be whether to initiate a sector plan amendment and send it back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9453)|
| 2:37:40| And in doing so, I would like for you to designate whether you're initiating a plan amendment for LDR, low density residential, or MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9460)|
| 2:37:53| There's no mention of the sector plan change on the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| I looked at the application and I didn't see it. Is it on the application? I've missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| You don't, they don't have the right to appeal a sector plan denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9480)|
| 2:38:06| What they've appealed is the denial of the rezoning and you can't act on the rezoning until the sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9486)|
| 2:38:13| I'm sorry to even go into this, but the state law is such that you can't act on the rezoning until the sector plan is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9493)|
| 2:38:23| But you do have the right to initiate your own sector plan amendment and send it back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| and it'll come back and at that point you can hear both the sector plan and the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| regardless of what the planning commission does with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9514)|
| 2:38:40| It's a pretty big barn to get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| Yeah, y'all need to quit building barns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| I don't know how I feel about the medium density residential on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9529)|
| 2:38:53| I was trying to look at the other zoning around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| Is there any medium density residential around there that you see on the zoning map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9536)|
| 2:39:07| I really don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| Most of the MDR stuff that we've dealt with, most of the apartments that you're aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| are over off of Salt Lake, off of in that area, down in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9556)|
| 2:39:22| And there's nothing development on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| The core, it's all purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| It's all BPTO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| There's no resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| So if we sent a medium residential request back for a sector plan look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9572)|
| 2:39:39| could they knock it down to low density instead of approving the medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| If the planners do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9585)|
| 2:39:53| As the official policy body of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| I think we would much rather react to what you want to do one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9598)|
| 2:40:05| We either tell you that what you're wanting to do is something that we can support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| or we'll tell you it's something that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| I don't know that we want to be in a position where we're going MDR is not good, but LDR is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9613)|
| 2:40:23| Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| I was about to ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| The commission does not have to choose between MDR and LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| You could initiate a sector plan amendment for one of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| There's no restriction in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| And that would give the Metropolitan Planning Commission the opportunity to make recommendations on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Calls to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9651)|
| 2:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| No matter what you decide on, the low density or the medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| it would be nice to know what he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| Because afterwards, if he gets the permission to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| is there any oversight or any supervision to know that he wouldn't be able to build more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| Go ahead, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| The presumption is that if either MDR or LDR is approved, the next thing would be the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9677)|
| 2:41:24| And that would be most likely to, for particularly low density residential, to plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9684)|
| 2:41:31| And the plan residential zone requires approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| He's talking about doing a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| There is a subdivision review process as well as a use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9697)|
| 2:41:42| which would limit the use of the property to either the single family or whatever type of housing he does propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9702)|
| 2:41:50| So he could put three per acre, he could put four per acre, six per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9710)|
| 2:41:56| He'll be assigned a number when his plan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| And then that's as far as it could go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| That's as far as it can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9722)|
| 2:42:03| And then I know that a couple of things, and I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| You know, there are more homes, they are being built along Hardin Valley to the east and to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| Some of them may be apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| I'm not quite sure what all of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| But we see that the entrances are being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| And again, I like that you're talking about it is a bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| But if he's allowed to put this in, it's going to make it worse and more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| I know that when I go out, there may be 12 cars there, there may be 20 cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| But the problem is that his subdivision would come out on a blind corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| The sight lines where the entrance to the subdivision that he would be planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9765)|
| 2:42:52| the sight lines are terrible on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| So it's anybody that's coming in or going out on Coward Mill that would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9774)|
| 2:43:00| Also, Hardin Valley, if the houses are built there, they would not go to Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| They would go to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| And I know that a lot of you have been saying, you know, we know that it's going to be developed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9788)|
| 2:43:14| We would just like to see businesses and offices, which wouldn't generate as many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9794)|
| 2:43:20| No one's going to go out all the way to the church to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| If they're going to Oak Ridge, possibly, but they're not going to go out that way to go around and go back south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| And Hardin Valley, I moved to Hardin Valley about seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| And it's booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| And we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| So somebody had the vision many years ago to set aside this property so that businesses could come in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9820)|
| 2:43:48| And just last year, UOK did again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| So we think that it should stay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| And there's housing that are going around all around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| But we just want to make it safe for the people who already live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9844)|
| 2:44:09| Go ahead, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| Mr. Kelly, just to make sure I understand this, the original application to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9853)|
| 2:44:19| the staff recommended denying medium density residential slash office as a sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9859)|
| 2:44:28| So they voted 14 to 1 to deny medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| It is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| What was the basis of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| Was it the road system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| What was their denial reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9882)|
| 2:44:45| One, from the standpoint of the technology corridor, the properties that are right along Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9885)|
| 2:44:55| those have the highest visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| Those are the properties that we would like to preserve for business type uses that fit within the technology corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9897)|
| 2:45:08| Probably just as important is the fact that the sector plan, the Northwest County sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| was just adopted in August of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| And it shows the property as it's designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| There hasn't been any change since 2016 that would suggest, as Mr. Seymour said, about the growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9921)|
| 2:45:32| All that was there in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| Wouldn't the highest and best use, if it hasn't sold for 25, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| wouldn't the highest and best use be something that somebody is willing to put on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9941)|
| 2:45:45| Well, you're talking about, you know, what you all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| and whatever you do will probably be the most appropriate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9950)|
| 2:45:54| That's what you're there to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| You know, I guess what I would like for you to think about is to draw back a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| look at it from up above, and the extension of Cherahala is only the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9962)|
| 2:46:09| There needs to be a frontage road that will go all the way along the parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| and eventually, hopefully, tie into Oak Ridge Highway somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| although crossing Beaver Creek is going to cost a blue million dollars to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| And then the improvements, the state needs to spend, you know, millions of dollars improving the Hardin Valley interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9982)|
| 2:46:31| So Hardin Valley interchange reminds me very much of Cedar Bluff before they did anything down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9991)|
| 2:46:39| You couldn't move on Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| And then they spent $20 million 20 years ago, which is probably $80 million today, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10002)|
| 2:46:52| So, you know, the significance of this particular rezoning is, you know, like Mr. Brantley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10012)|
| 2:47:05| you know, like throwing a bucket of water in a swimming pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| but it is a departure from what has been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| And so it will be viewed by others in the future as a precedent setting action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10034)|
| 2:47:22| Can I ask one more question, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10042)|
| 2:47:25| What if, what other, I just, I want to see what this Cherahala discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10045)|
| 2:47:32| you know, I don't know that I'm for it unless Cherahala is built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| So is there another option besides sending it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| Or is that your only option if you didn't want to deny the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| At this point, to develop it as residential, you need a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10065)|
| 2:47:50| And before you have a zoning change, you'll need a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10070)|
| 2:47:54| Without the planning commission having initiated the sector plan, the sector plan needs to be initiated by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10074)|
| 2:48:06| Dan, a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| You said this would be set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| Haven't we oftentimes taken property that was in the technical overlay and turned it into residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10091)|
| 2:48:19| Not those frontage parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| On the other side of Pellissippi is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| Yeah, but didn't local motors just, they're across the street on the other side of Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10105)|
| 2:48:31| It's not residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| Frontage parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| Commissioner Bressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| One way or the other, we're going to have to deal with this because it's going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10118)|
| 2:48:45| They've got a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| It can either be voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10127)|
| 2:48:50| Whether the road is going to be developed or not, we've got a man's piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10130)|
| 2:48:58| And even if it's in your district, you make a suggestion of what you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10138)|
| 2:49:04| But we're going to have to deal with it ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| We're going to deal with it now or we're going to deal with it later is basically the question we're facing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| Hey, Brad, can I go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| Many things I've heard from the people is the density and also the lack of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10163)|
| 2:49:28| Could you live with LDR and LDR up to five units an acre with the premise that in a year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10168)|
| 2:49:39| if you haven't started your development, you could come back for a higher density if this road does get built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| I didn't understand your, I mean if that was, I want the residents, I mean the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10187)|
| 2:49:55| although the last guy there can't always be the last guy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| I mean that's kind of what, you know, I've got my house and I don't want somebody else to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10198)|
| 2:50:04| But that's not greatly a safe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| And so I want to make sure we're doing right by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| And so I guess my motion would be to send back to MPC to look at, can I do plan residential or does that have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10211)|
| 2:50:23| At this point all you need to do is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| Low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| Initiate a plan amendment for low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10228)|
| 2:50:32| They can, you need to send the zoning back also and they can amend that request to plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10232)|
| 2:50:42| and then it will all come back to you at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| And it will get two reviews under plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| We would get the MPC review and the Tech Carter Development Authority reviews the plans also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10248)|
| 2:50:56| I don't have a, I mean I really don't have a problem with the land developing out at three or four an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10256)|
| 2:51:02| I just, the coward mill, I mean I live out there, I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10262)|
| 2:51:08| And I think if we can get a road plan out there that improves and possibly cuts off coward mill, I think we all win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10268)|
| 2:51:15| And so I'm going to send it, again, Rusty knows this, without the intent of proving it next time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10275)|
| 2:51:21| I want to send it back for a low density residential review, plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10281)|
| 2:51:26| And also, this is on a separate, that would be my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10286)|
| 2:51:30| but Development Corporation and Engineering have to be a part of this discussion because we can't do it without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10290)|
| 2:51:36| So that's my motion is to send it back with two MPC to look at low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10296)|
| 2:51:45| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10305)|
| 2:51:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Real quickly, for the residents, you will have an opportunity, if this passes and sent back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| you will have an opportunity again to come before MPC and challenge, if you want to use the word challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| the density at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| So just for you all to know that this is not the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| You all can come back at least two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| And it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| And it will come back to us also, three times probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10331)|
| 2:52:17| If you might want to follow the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10337)|
| 2:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| We have a motion before us and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| Before we call for the vote, is there anybody else that wants to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10348)|
| 2:52:34| If that's okay, I just want to make sure that we're doing the right thing by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| My name is Catherine Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10359)|
| 2:52:40| And my father was an original investor in this property when I was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10360)|
| 2:52:45| So I just did want to speak to something Ms. Pettit said, that there was a vision for this property originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10365)|
| 2:52:52| And truly, when he bought it in 1976, it was zoned planned residential, 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10372)|
| 2:53:00| I live in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| I raised my family here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| We drive out to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| I've been on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| We certainly don't want to cause any issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| And I do think what Mr. Biddle has proposed is very reasonable, considering the development that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10389)|
| 2:53:15| Glad to hear that Knox County and TDOT are working to amend the road and traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| So I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10400)|
| 2:53:28| With a proper motion in front of us and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10413)|
| 2:53:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10421)|

| 2:56:09| Yeah, I believe this is in regards to the agriculture that we had the discussion about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10569)|

| 2:56:42| Yeah, does this paragraph that has been added by the law department, does that satisfy the concerns of the Ag extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10602)|
| 2:56:50| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| Commissioner Neister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| I'd like to move that we approve ordinance 017-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10618)|
| 2:57:04| All right, we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| I'll move that we approve this ordinance establishing regulations for rural retreat facilities subject to the revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10626)|
| 2:57:14| and to hand out Commissioner Busler provided to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| and to the clerk clarifying that this ordinance does not regulate agriculture as defined by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10637)|
| 2:57:25| That is what I'd like to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| I'd also like to frankly recognize and thank Neal for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| He does an awful lot of great work for our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| and it's not often that we get to have someone who's actually really, truly important for our community appear before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10656)|
| 2:57:42| Neal, thank you for your dedication to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| We greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| I'll make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| We'll have to amend the motion since the motion has already been made, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| He can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| It's a friendly motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| I'd like to make that a substitute motion, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| That's what I get for talking to somebody outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| I'll make a substitute second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| I see Mr. King standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| Name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| No, Mr. Chairman, with the exception of a very short question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10695)|
| 2:58:22| I have a copy of the handout that is to the Knox County Commission from Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10702)|
| 2:58:31| and it contains an amendment to Section 2-20 of Article 2 and a new proposed subsection of 4.104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10711)|
| 2:58:44| I just want to make sure that the clerks have that, and that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| I would like to personally thank Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Busler, and Commissioner Nystrom for the work they've put in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10733)|
| 2:59:05| And Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| You too, Mr. King, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| You don't get recognized if you're getting paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| Okay, we have a motion properly in front of us in a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10762)|
| 2:59:27| You know, it seems kind of odd, Mr. Chairman, that these people have sat here that long out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| I think we should invite them to stay to the very end if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10771)|
| 2:59:41| Maybe they can get a good night's sleep now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| I'm saying this half joking and half serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| The University of Tennessee Ag Campus has a campaign called Tennessee Magic Moments where the ag is capitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10787)|
| 2:59:57| This could probably pass as one of the magic moments for agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10797)|
| 3:00:02| So if any of you all are on social media, put that out with the hashtag for Tennessee Magic Moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10802)|
| 3:00:08| And my wife, who works as an executive on the Ag Campus, I know would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| O178102, amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, zoning Article II, Section 2.20, specific terms, Article V, Section 5.36, T, transition zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10817)|
| 3:00:29| and Section 5.41, OB, office, medical, and related services zone, and adding a new Article IV, Section 4.105, standards for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10829)|
| 3:00:39| approval of supportive housing, related to supportive housing, Ordinance No. 099130, adopted 9-10-90, as amended, second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10839)|
| 3:00:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10852)|
| 3:00:58| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10861)|
| 3:01:02| Yeah, again, we would ask that this ordinance be divided into two separate ordinances from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10862)|
| 3:01:12| One call it supportive housing, and the other call it recovery housing for the reasons that we gave during the public hearing the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10872)|
| 3:01:27| Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| As I mentioned in the public meeting, I will suggest and recommend that we make one small revision in order to be compliant with the Fair Housing Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10889)|
| 3:01:39| and that is to amend the definition of supportive housing to mean housing for six or more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10899)|
| 3:01:48| rather than the five-number threshold that MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| That is, I can explain that and go into greater detail about it, but I recommend that in order to meet the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10914)|
| 3:02:02| Yes, sir, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| Yes, sir, my name is Jared Garceau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| My address is PO Box 2425, Knoxville, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10927)|
| 3:02:12| I represent Mandala Recovery Services, LLC, which is the applicant on the Ebenezer property that kind of initiated this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10932)|
| 3:02:25| After watching the work session, I wasn't able to be here last Monday, but I went back and reviewed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10945)|
| 3:02:32| and I specifically watched for Mr. Schoonmaker's concerns, which were raised in the last meeting as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10952)|
| 3:02:41| about needing two separate definitions primarily for the purpose of allowing the ordinance to exclude drugs and alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10961)|
| 3:02:53| from facilities that are housing residents suffering from drug and alcohol addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10973)|
| 3:02:59| and then not excluding drugs and alcohol from other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10979)|
| 3:03:04| I do not think that a full separate set of regulations for both types of uses is necessary to address that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10984)|
| 3:03:14| I think that concern can be addressed by a very simple amendment to the proposed ordinance language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=10994)|
| 3:03:24| Currently, the ordinance has a definition, which is supportive housing, housing for six or more persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11004)|
| 3:03:35| if Mr. Sanders' suggested amendment is adopted, with no limit on the length of stay that is occupied by the target population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11015)|
| 3:03:46| and the target population is defined as people experiencing substance abuse or other chronic health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11026)|
| 3:03:54| Then we have a set of supplementary regulations, and all we have to do to address the concern that Mr. Schoonmaker has raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11034)|
| 3:04:04| is add one more standard to the supplementary regulations that states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11044)|
| 3:04:11| alcohol and illegal drugs shall not be permitted on the premises of any supportive housing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11051)|
| 3:04:18| whose target population includes people recovering from or experiencing substance abuse problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11058)|
| 3:04:26| That addresses the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| If the concern is that we want to be able to exclude those substances from facilities housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11069)|
| 3:04:37| individuals recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, that can be accomplished by adding that one additional standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11077)|
| 3:04:45| Beyond that, I don't see the reason to have a set of separate standards for individuals suffering from drug addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11085)|
| 3:04:55| or individuals who are experiencing other chronic health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11095)|
| 3:05:03| So I would propose that that one amendment would address that concern without giving the need to send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11103)|
| 3:05:10| and go through the whole process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| We've been in this process now since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| It's been six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| There can be no denying that Knox County is terribly afflicted with the opioid epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11118)|
| 3:05:25| I know that there was a study that drug-related deaths increased in Knox County two-fold from 2010 to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11125)|
| 3:05:34| So this is something that has to be addressed in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| and currently the county ordinance does not permit this type of facility anywhere in the county expressly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11137)|
| 3:05:45| There's not a definition and there's not a single zoning classification that addresses this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11145)|
| 3:05:52| So what the MPC has proposed is a broad definition, but it sets it up as a use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11152)|
| 3:06:01| Lots of information has to be submitted to the MPC under that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11161)|
| 3:06:07| The use-on-review process also gives concerned citizens near one of these developments the opportunity to voice their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11167)|
| 3:06:15| at the use-on-review stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| And for that reason, I think that the proposal should be adopted with Mr. Sanders' suggested amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11177)|
| 3:06:23| and with the addition of that one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11183)|
| 3:06:28| Mr. Kelly, your thoughts, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| We would have no objection to either amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| I mean, if none of my colleagues see the need to have two separate designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11196)|
| 3:06:42| that would go into a entity going next door to a residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11202)|
| 3:06:49| to actually be classified what you're doing there, either recovery housing or supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11209)|
| 3:06:57| then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| But I would think that if you have residential neighborhoods in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11219)|
| 3:07:05| this would be something that would be very important to have a separate classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11225)|
| 3:07:10| for both type housings because the Mandela folks, they're doing an awesome job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11230)|
| 3:07:15| Knox County has not done anything to them for the past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| All I'm saying is we just need to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| They do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| They don't allow drugs or alcohol in that facility, and that's the way it needs to be classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| It does not need to be classified as supportive housing because that has another tone of homeless housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11249)|
| 3:07:36| as it's sometimes referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| So going into your neighborhoods, if someone has an MPC filing and it says supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11259)|
| 3:07:47| what do you think the first thing they're going to think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker and other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11272)|
| 3:07:58| The purpose of doing this through the use on review process is to be able to take one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11278)|
| 3:08:06| and you may have one type of facility that is proposed for that particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11286)|
| 3:08:11| and it may be okay there, but it wouldn't be okay somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| That's what the use on review process allows you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| And through the process, the information that has to be provided is who their target population is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11298)|
| 3:08:25| what is the chronic issue that these people are dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11305)|
| 3:08:31| what type of treatment is going to be provided or facilities are going to be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11311)|
| 3:08:38| what's the program that they're going to have which will flesh out what, in fact, is going to be going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11318)|
| 3:08:46| I think what you're talking about is just a matter of definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| What I think you're talking about is what some people may think of as supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11330)|
| 3:09:00| is not what our definition is, and what the proposed definition is the one that you have to be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11340)|
| 3:09:08| Does it cover the target population that we're trying to deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11348)|
| 3:09:14| Homelessness unto itself is not a chronic illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| so you wouldn't have homeless people living in a supportive living facility if their only issue was they're homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11358)|
| 3:09:31| So from that standpoint, I don't know that we've, if you're saying we need to address the homeless situation too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11371)|
| 3:09:38| that's a different issue altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11382)|
| 3:09:44| I like the amendment that, I'm sorry, I forgot your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11384)|
| 3:09:48| Jared Garcelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11388)|
| 3:09:49| I like your amendment, but I would like to also, wherever it says supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| it says supportive slash recovery housing, and that way they will have to declare for sure what they're going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11394)|
| 3:10:01| Are they going for supportive housing or are they going for recovery housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| Is that possible, Dan, to add recovery slash recovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11404)|
| 3:10:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| I need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| Didn't mean to make you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| Every, I presume everyone who will be in this type of housing is recovering from something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11417)|
| 3:10:29| Would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| They're dealing with chronic, someone who has a chronic condition or illness would be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11432)|
| 3:10:38| and so the assumption is that they would be attempting to recover from something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| whether it be drugs and alcohol or some other illness of some sort, chronic illness or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11443)|
| 3:10:50| So I think that would probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| So I can see Mr. Schoonmaker positioned to where supportive housing is someone that's needing housing for six months at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11453)|
| 3:11:02| and they have no drug or alcohol problem and if they want to have a drink there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| that's, you know, and they're regulated, that's fine, but recovery housing is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11467)|
| 3:11:12| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11472)|
| 3:11:13| They cannot have, they should not, I'm going to say cannot, they should not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11473)|
| 3:11:17| they should be restricted from having that drugs or alcohol there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11477)|
| 3:11:22| I don't know, you know, fully 10% of the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11482)|
| 3:11:30| and I dare say that many of you have family members who may have been touched by drug or alcohol abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11490)|
| 3:11:39| or extended family or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| and I have never heard of a drug and alcohol substance abuse facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11502)|
| 3:11:48| that's going to allow you to have drugs and alcohol on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11508)|
| 3:11:53| That's your quickest ticket out of the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| They breathalyze people when they come back from their weekend off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11517)|
| 3:12:03| That, again, like I say, that is the quickest ticket out of a drug and alcohol treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11523)|
| 3:12:08| is if you have drugs and alcohol on your person or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11528)|
| 3:12:17| And I, just to expand on that, I do think that that concern can be addressed directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11537)|
| 3:12:24| by just adding the additional condition in the supplementary regulations that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| alcohol and illegal drugs shall not be permitted on the premises of any supportive housing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11550)|
| 3:12:36| whose target population includes people recovering from or experiencing substance abuse problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11556)|
| 3:12:44| You add that in, and if they have someone in the facility who's there because they're a recovering addict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11564)|
| 3:12:52| there cannot be alcohol or illegal drugs on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| I guess I go back to Commissioner Schoonmaker when he asked the colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11578)|
| 3:13:02| didn't our law director just state that it would be a violation of the Fair Housing Act to separate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| Is that what I understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| No, I didn't indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11590)|
| 3:13:12| My issue was with the number of individuals that constitute supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11592)|
| 3:13:17| Okay, that was my, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11597)|
| 3:13:23| Okay, okay, I had that discombobulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11605)|
| 3:13:26| And I could comment on that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11606)|
| 3:13:30| It's not, it wouldn't necessarily be a concern under the Fair Housing Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11610)|
| 3:13:35| if you're putting regulations on individuals who are living together in groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11615)|
| 3:13:43| larger than what's generally permitted in the county for unrelated individuals to live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| So that's where the six instead of five comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| But then beyond that, if you have a separate set of standards for different individuals with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11633)|
| 3:14:02| you still have concerns under the Americans with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| In other words, if you allow individuals with dementia or HIV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11647)|
| 3:14:13| or whatever other chronic health condition that would be housed in a supportive housing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11653)|
| 3:14:18| if you only have these requirements placed on those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11658)|
| 3:14:23| but then individuals suffering from drug and alcohol addiction have XYZ additional requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11663)|
| 3:14:31| or whatever, then you're running into a concern of whether you're discriminating against one particular class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11671)|
| 3:14:38| of disabled individuals because of their disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11678)|
| 3:14:43| That's the big concern under the federal anti-discrimination laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| The one thing I've learned about this discussion so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| and getting some outside sourcing that's tried to educate me a little bit on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11696)|
| 3:15:01| there's many different types of substance abuses and they affect people in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11701)|
| 3:15:07| And what I'd like to go, as we're talking about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11707)|
| 3:15:11| I'm kind of confused on the way the state handles supportive housing or halfway houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11711)|
| 3:15:21| or whatever classification it comes under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11721)|
| 3:15:25| And to me, I am kind of really not educated in this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11725)|
| 3:15:34| I'm going with someone who is trying to educate us here to say, hey, this is what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11734)|
| 3:15:42| My question to you is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| Okay, you say there's not supposed to be drugs or alcohol in these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11744)|
| 3:15:49| and that's regulated by the state, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| Or is that locally regulated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11752)|
