| 0:03:17| We've got a lot going on in Knoxville this week, and I want to take time to recognize a few events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| First of all, the Medal of Honor Convention, which I have a mug, a souvenir mug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| The Medal of Honor recipients and their families are in town for this year's Medal of Honor Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| As you probably know, the Medal of Honor is the most prestigious military decoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| that is awarded to recognize service members who have gone above and beyond the call of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| If you've had the opportunity to meet any of the Medal of Honor recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| during their last convention in Knoxville in 2014, you know their stories inspire and motivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| So please make these special guests and their families feel welcome when you see them around Knoxville this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| Also, this Sunday is September 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| I want to invite council and community members to our annual 9-11 Remembrance Ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| on the city county lawn right outside this building this Sunday just after 8.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| City and county leaders along with the fire chief and police chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| will take time to remember the lives lost 21 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| This ceremony is open to the public and is a way for all of us to pause, honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and reflect on the lives lost that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Immediately following the wreath-laying ceremony at the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| the annual 9-11 stair climb will take place at the Sun Sphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| and that's a really special event I think council members have attended in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| and I encourage you to attend this year too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Next, we just had Labor Day yesterday, and I'm really proud that here in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| we don't just celebrate Labor Day with picnics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| We also celebrate it by giving our workers competitive wages, $15 starting pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| and great benefits and paid holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| So if you know someone who's looking for work, we have a job fair that is right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| The city's public service job fair is next Thursday, September 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| 8 a.m. to noon at the Public Works Service Center at 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| We have more than 30 open positions, including many entry-level positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| Again, the city is a great place to work and lots of room for advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Also tonight, we have a member of our youth council here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Owen Davis from West High School is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Owen, thank you for your commitment to help our city and for serving on the youth council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| and I think we'll have a member of youth council here attending council meetings throughout the school year to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| And now we have a legally obliged announcement I want to share with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| about our finance and debt announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| In your packets, you will find Form CT-0253,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| which is a document necessary to complete the bond refunding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| which you all approved on August 9th and which was finalized last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| You may recall that this pertains to the $60 million, $65,000 worth of convention-centered debt that was refunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| The refunding transaction resulted in some debt payment savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| and enabled us to transfer from the old financial index, LIBOR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| to the new one called SOFR, S-O-F-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| One of the requirements from last month's refunding closing is that this form be provided to each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| This document was filed with the state of Tennessee's Office of State and Local Finance shortly after refunding the debt last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| Just in case we need to show later that you all were provided a copy of the form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| we thought it best to send it to you along with your council packets and call your attention to it during the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| so the minutes will reflect that it was provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| So please make sure that the minutes reflect this, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| You don't need to do anything with the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| We are just fulfilling the refunding closing requirements by furnishing it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| If you have any questions or need any further information about this form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| do not hesitate to ask Boyce Evans, our CFO, either now or you can call him at any time after this meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| Let this be reflected in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Any questions for Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Finally, a quick reminder that those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| should sign up with Mr. Johnson, our city recorder, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Please do not use profanity, and when speaking to specific agenda items, please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| For those who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Thanks in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| And that's it for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Are there any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=459)|

| 0:07:45| you may have noticed that our last meeting we had a timer set for council's debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| and after that meeting the mayor and I sat down and had a discussion about the written rules that have been adopted by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| and that is a rule that we have in our council debate rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| and so going forward we will be following the rules as written and adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| So you'll see that timer come back tonight in meetings going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| so I just wanted to make sure everyone recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Yes, just a few words about our traffic calming program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| If you live in Oakwood and Lincoln Park, you may have noticed a series of speed bumps that have been built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| even as we speak, mainly on Chickamauga Avenue, which was one of the busiest thoroughfares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| and also on adjacent roads, and they are clearly marked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| and it's a credit, I think, to the traffic program that we have now in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| These didn't mysteriously appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| They were part of a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| I'd like to give accolades to Debbie Sharp and Haley Howard for helping to implement this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| but also community activists David Penninger and Matt Morlock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| who kind of were the neighborhood folks that initiated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| and all this started just with them getting the ideas and getting in contact and following the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| and it took a few months, but it's manifested itself into reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| and so if you travel any of those roads at the moment, you can already see a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| Also, as practical as they should practically have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| there's many of them around Oakwood Avenue, which is up and down Christenbury Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| so the prominent implementation was to keep our kids safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| and to put them in slow traffic around the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| so thank you to all the folks that worked on that and got it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| I just want to give a shout-out to the Asian Festival that happened the previous weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| It was a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| What I really enjoyed was seeing the community come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Asian American means 60 different countries or more, and I am part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| and to just see everybody getting along and enjoying the cultural, beautiful things that were going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| just does my heart good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Yeah, thank you to all those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I echo your compliments and praise for what a wonderful event, and a lot of people made it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=639)|

| 0:11:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| 9C is an ordinance amending Chapter 26, Article 4, Section 26-410 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| relating to record rotation list rates and charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=700)|

| 0:11:46| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I heard from the Record Commission that they needed to make a change to this in Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| It says right now the ordinance shall take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| So that would mean it would take effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| And the request was to replace that with this ordinance shall take effect 17 days from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| and after its passage, the welfare of the city requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| And if I could, Mayor, just ask Director Evans a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| Director Evans, the reason for this change is that there's some time needed to update the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=743)|
| 0:12:33| in these rates to be effective, and doing it immediately would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| I talked to the Director of Fleet Services that runs the impound lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| and they could have that fully in place in their software that's used for this every day, every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| about a two-week period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| So, I mean, they do need the time to get it updated so we can get it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| and people aren't getting charged erroneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| So, Vice Mayor, you want to make a motion to amend it by the language you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| 17 days instead of immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Is there a second to that motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Okay, does everyone understand the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Council Member Ryder, do you have a question about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Any further questions or discussion on the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Seeing none, all those in favor of the amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| The motion to amend carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Now back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Yeah, so appreciate you explaining that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Do we have any sense of how many tows might happen in that time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| That's 17 days, a little over about two and a half weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| I'm just asking because it's been months since they asked for the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| It's taken a while to deliberate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| so I just wondered what volume would be impacted by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| The motion came up about how long to get it practically put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| so it would be proper and not have a bunch of hiccups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| I talked to Fleet Nick, and he just said about two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| but I didn't dig any further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| My question is, is that a substantive change that requires us to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| on emergency ordinance, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| That was my question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Seeing no further questions, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| 11A is a resolution to pause the Public Art Committee's sculpture project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| for the Cradle of Country Music Park for six months to allow time for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| to determine a way to preserve the mature trees on the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Council Members, there's a number of people signed up to speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| and against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Just beforehand, I think all Council Members are aware that during the last two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| I have had an opportunity to work with the Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| and the Public Arts Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| and we have come up with a plan to revise the base and the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| and landscaping so that all the trees that are currently there will be saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| except one, and we're going to be planting, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| with another 22 additional trees and adding green space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| So I think if you – I don't know if we've had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| This has all been being put together pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| but I'm really pleased with the result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| and I think it's a win for art and a win for saving the trees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| So I just wanted to provide that context before we go into the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| I'll go ahead, and the first person signed up to speak in favor of this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| is Dr. Rose Abramoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=959)|
| 0:16:12| You'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Since there aren't very many speaker spots open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| can I ask that you trade places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| You can just say that you don't want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| and we'll pass on to the next person who is Axel Ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Okay, Mr. Ring, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Mayor Kincaid, I want to thank you very much for your proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| and for the various stakeholders that have been willing to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| to achieve a common goal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Anyway, Mayor Kincaid and my honorable men and women of the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| I'm Axel Ring of 1840 Lafayette Road, New Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| and Conservation Chair of the Harvey Broom Group of the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| I'm representing tonight the 1,000 or so members of the Sierra Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| who live in Knoxville, as well as the many people who have signed petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| asking that the trees be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I believe the number of signatures to the petition is now over 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| Let me be very clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| We do not oppose the sculpture project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| There has been, I think, misunderstandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| and perhaps misinformation thrown around over the last year about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| All we are about is saving the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| We believe the sculpture and the trees can coexist and complement each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| The resolution before you tonight asks the City to pause the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| to give people of goodwill time to find a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| that incorporates a sculpture into the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| while saving the trees that define the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I'm glad to hear that the Mayor and the various people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| who have been providing input have come up with a solution for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| Those trees forming the urban forest canopy in Cradle of Country Music Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| are an irreplaceable and valuable asset for Knoxville residents and visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| in today's world of increasing extreme temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| There are only three locations in downtown with a forest canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Crutch Park, Market Square, and the CCMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| We cannot afford to lose any part of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| while replacing them with concrete and pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| The urban heat island effect is real and will get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| When average temperatures exceed 95 degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| the local temperature over concrete and asphalt will exceed 105 degrees or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| while the temperature under a mature tree canopy will be only 90 degrees or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| We want a livable and sustainable city for our residents and our visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| In April of this year, President Biden issued Executive Order 14072,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1141)|

| 0:19:12| which recognizes the importance of protecting and retaining mature trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| to address the challenges of climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| While not binding on our city, it articulates why we all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| private citizens as well as governments at all levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| should do everything we can to protect our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Current peer-reviewed research indicates mature trees have much more value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| in soaking up rainwater, in reducing downtown temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| in cleaning our air, and in absorbing noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| We do not have decades to wait for saplings to grow into mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Climate change is here and is accelerating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| On August 3rd of this year, 124 million people in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| were under an extreme heat warning from the National Weather Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| That's more than a third of the people in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| By 2050, according to the National Weather Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| the Knoxville area is expected to experience more than 35 days of extreme heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| Higher temperatures compromise human health and comfort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| with an increased risk of respiratory illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and heat-related mortality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| The most cost-effective way to mitigate increased urban temperatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| is to retain the existing mature trees downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| as well as to plant many more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| And I'd like to close with some words from the famous poem by Joyce Kilmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Please vote yes on the resolution to pause the project for the trees and for the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and I would be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| The next person signed up to speak in favor of this is Will Skelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Mr. Skelton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1275)|
| 0:21:30| I'm Will Skelton, 4064 Kingston Park Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| And as many of you know, I have a long time been a lover of trees and greenways and natural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| Charlie and I worked on those greenways in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| And I've also practiced law for around 40 years until I retired in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| So I got to love the trees we had, the few trees we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| And I had a talk here, five minutes worth, and I don't need that anymore in view of what the mayor just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| So I mainly want to say I really, really appreciate the mayor, his staff, David over there, who I know pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1324)|
| 0:22:13| and all the city council listening to the public and standing up for our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| That's not always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I'm also personally just totally happy to live in a progressive city with some city council people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| and a mayor that are progressive and listen to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| And the resolution you're going to pass in a few minutes also indicates that, I think, about the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| I do want just to quickly read Jim Cortese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Most of you have heard of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| He was a really respectful, Cortese Tree Service or whatever it was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| He couldn't be here tonight because of a sickness in his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| But he had written us several times about what he was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| And here's a quote I want to read, which is kind of capsulized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| summarizes the value of these few trees we have downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| It is very hard to get trees to grow in the awful downtown soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| One of the rules of arboriculture and tree planting that I have learned over the last 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| is that you never cut down an established tree in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| regardless of species, because of the hardness and difficulty of getting new trees established and to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| So we need to keep the trees that we have as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| And frankly, I also want to add a historical note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Twenty years ago, about 20 years ago, some of you were here then will remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| the city was actually planning to cut down all those trees someone mentioned a minute ago on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| They were going to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| All those beautiful oak trees were going to be cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| They were seriously planning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| And again, to their credit, our city mayor and city council listened to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and we now have those great trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So in summary, or in ending, I'd just like to say you're saving these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Hopefully this can be the beginning of a conversation between the people who care for trees and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| and the city about making downtown Knoxville an even more greener city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1453)|

| 0:25:03| And I don't know if you've noticed it lately, but music has become Knoxville's greatest ambassador to the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1503)|
| 0:25:14| Knoxville's national and international identity is being shaped by music right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| more than politics, more than football, more than any other cultural force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1521)|
| 0:25:31| Music is really the reason why people from all over the world make an annual pilgrimage to Knoxville and spend millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1531)|
| 0:25:45| They come in increasing numbers from all points of the globe, and they take the news back with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1545)|

| 0:26:01| But it often gets the shaft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| It's often overlooked, other things more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| But it's really not a PR scheme or hype or another roadside attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| Music is truly our story, and now is not the time to be pushing aside our rich musical heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1575)|
| 0:26:26| It's time to really be gathering our musical story, making it more inclusive and stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| and better presenting it to the world when they come and walk up and down our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| When I served as Knoxville's first poet laureate for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| I worked very closely with the Public Arts Committee and the Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| I was honored to work with them, and I feel real good about our collaborations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| I found them all to be good, hardworking people doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| And when they presented the project for the Cradle of Country Music, that's what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| And when a prior city council voted to pass certain parts of that project, that's what they were doing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1631)|
| 0:27:20| It was all about public art, and that's good, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| But there were a couple of things that were never mentioned, much less discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| One of them was the destruction of the trees, and the other was country music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| At that point, it was all about the artwork and adapting everything to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| Well, there was some pushback locally and from the state of Tennessee about a couple of aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| Not to get into all that, but to push forward here, the Public Arts Committee has said they would keep the name of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1672)|
| 0:28:04| and they would bring back the plaques with the names of the individuals that the park is dedicated to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| and they would add a few more names to include African American musicians who had contributed to our music heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| That's all well and good, but since that time, they've basically done nothing to make any plans to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1698)|
| 0:28:32| If you talk to the design people who are making the maps for the project and ask them if they've got any new designs for the plaques,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1712)|
| 0:28:43| they would say to us, what plaques?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| We don't know anything about plaques coming in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| And the professional people, the music and history people that the Public Arts Committee will need to speak with to do a better job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1729)|
| 0:28:59| to accomplish this, there's been no interaction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| I'm just saying that the Public Arts Committee needs to make a deeper commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| I'm supporting this resolution because I want to see them sit down and actually work out some plans to bring the plaques back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1749)|
| 0:29:18| and to expand our dedication in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| This is the hour to do that as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| And that's why I'm here speaking in behalf of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| Council members, we also have three people signed up to speak against this resolution to postpone, so the first is James Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1789)|
| 0:30:18| Hello, Mayor and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| My name is W. James Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| I used to walk up here a lot faster than that when I was a police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| But I'm here tonight to tell you that myself along with other committee members like Terry Mosley and Tommy Rush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1827)|
| 0:30:38| have been serving on this committee for over five and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| We were all there for a lot of the public process that brought about this sculpture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| and this piece of art that's going to be put in the park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| When Mayor Rogerio called and asked me to volunteer my time to serve on this wonderful committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1855)|
| 0:31:03| I was really honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Being somebody that grew up here in Knoxville from Lonsdale Homes Projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| now I'm on a committee, and it was just amazing the things that we have done through this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| And over the past eight years, the Public Art Committee and hundreds of other citizens have put thousands of hours into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1879)|
| 0:31:27| And we think it's going to be a fantastic place for everybody to congregate and come to the pier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| I thought that was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| And I have a studio that's close to where this sculpture is going to be put, and I'm a singer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| And if you want to hear me sing, you'll probably see me under the canopy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| I will be there because I'm down on the Market Square a lot busking, just doing that and giving my money to the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1909)|
| 0:31:58| I do that. That's what I do because I've been blessed in my life to be able to live a comfortable life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| Now, after retirement, after 10 years, that guy was talking about he was 70. I just turned 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| God has been good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| So what I want to do tonight is please support the Cradle of Music Park Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| and all the hard work that's gone into it over the past eight years, and please let it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| Because I think it's going to be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| I moved away in 1979 after resigning from the police department to become this great artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| and it took me a long time, but God has given me a little payback on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| And coming back to Knoxville, I had to come back because my mama, we used to ride down Gate Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| and we couldn't go into the building where my mama is housed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| That's my name, Geneva Galleries. That's my gallery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| So all this is about beautifying Knoxville and changing it, and it has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| When I moved away in 1979, I came back when I was 62 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| It's changed a lot, and I know about Knoxville because I'm from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| I was a police officer here, and I served, and I love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| That's why I came back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| If I could, please, let's try to get this moving forward because it's going to be beautiful for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| and you'll be able to hear me sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| And I think you'd like to also look for me on America's Got Talent coming up in season 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| I just want to put that out there, but I think this is a beautiful piece of artwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| and we spent a lot of time on it, so please let this move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Taylor, if you could just provide your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I forgot to ask you at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Your address or your studio address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| My address is 934 Spring Park Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, S&E Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| My studio is 102, 100 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| Next person signed up to speak in opposition to this is Lisa Zenni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Ms. Zenni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you, James Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I'm Lisa Zenni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I can always be found either at 100 South Gate Street or the Emporium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| but my legal address is 113 Baylor Drive in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you all for your service to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| I'm so happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| I'm so proud to have had the opportunity to work with the extraordinary group of people right over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2092)|
| 0:35:01| Would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| The City of Knoxville's Public Art Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2102)|
| 0:35:13| They volunteer, and they are here tonight as they have been for the past eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| steadily toiling on behalf of the city they love by showing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| quietly putting in the hard work of participating when it counts to make our city better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| Just because you won't hear members of the Public Art Committee hooting, hollering, hissing, and heckling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| doesn't mean they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| They care just as much as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Their care is written all over this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| And their fingerprints include every color of the rainbow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| The Public Art Committee is 50% people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| They've had their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| They've toiled and worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| They've loved this project, and their hearts are in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| Architects, foundation leaders, Guggenheim winners, internationally known glass and oil artists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| business people, musicians, social service workers, landscape designers, graphic designers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| tourism leaders, and other devoted citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| But fussing isn't their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| They let the hard work of participating speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| One former member of the Public Art Committee resigned at the beginning of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| but she didn't want to take the time to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Because we all know it's a lot harder to participate than to protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| In 2013, the city asked the committee to dedicate their efforts to improving the Cradle of Country Music Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| After all, it's one of our busiest entryways into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| The committee tackled the assignment transparently and with great integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| They conducted a four-year public process that drew on the hopes and ideas of hundreds of Knoxville citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2234)|
| 0:37:24| who answered 40 separate calls to engage in the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| Together, members of the public invested over 8,000 hours of unpaid time to give input into this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2252)|
| 0:37:43| And all that work led to the powerful, iconic design you have before you that reflects that public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2263)|
| 0:37:52| Public process is important. Let's honor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| Don't give in to those who for four years refused to participate in the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| But now, when all the hard work's been done, seek to trespass on the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2284)|

| 0:38:21| You can see the proof of that with your eyes on the cover of the project proposal submitted by Mark Fornes on July 27, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2301)|
| 0:38:33| It's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| In the last few weeks, the city and the Community Design Center have actually made the project even better and more engaging than it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| I wouldn't have thought it was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| The proposal the mayor presented earlier today will heighten the experience of the artwork for the public and preserve all but one 15-year-old tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2329)|
| 0:38:59| The result of their work is a wonderful win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2339)|

| 0:39:16| Here's a truth for you. We all love trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And this new proposal preserves even more trees than the city's compromise last fall did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Artists love trees. Artists love one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Some of you on city council may remember that at a candidate's forum I moderated at the Emporium a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| That's your five minutes. Do you want to finish the sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| I want to say that every artist has a style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2381)|

| 0:39:47| Looking at the details of a very intricate piece is what makes it exquisite and it will draw people back to the sculpture time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2387)|
| 0:39:56| This public art committee saved its money for six years to afford this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2396)|

| 0:40:08| You know where to find me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Council members, two additional people have signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| The six people that your rules allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| If you wish to suspend your rules, you can say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Oh, I'm sorry. One other person signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Dwayne Greve. Sorry, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Mr. Greve, if you could come up. You know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| State your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| I'm never quite sure how to follow Lisa in terms of what she has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| Dwayne Greve, I'm the executive director of the East Tennessee Community Design Center, 1300 North Broadway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| Actually, what I'm here for tonight is I'm here to answer questions of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| Lisa's already gone through the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Just as a disclaimer, I was on the Public Arts Committee when this project started back in 2013 and 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| And I participated in the whole process as it went along until I went off council and went off and went off the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| But what I wanted to address really this evening is that the mayor and her staff got in touch with us two weeks ago after the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2479)|
| 0:41:28| And asked if the design center could take a look at the park and look at the art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| and see if there's a way in which to keep both the art and the trees on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| So in the past two weeks, what we've done is we have spent numerous hours at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| We've examined the trees. We've examined the contours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And we've come up with what I think is a solution to where we're saving of the five trees, we're saving four of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2507)|
| 0:41:56| Only one tree would be cut down, and that is the tree that is directly in front of the base and the arts itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| We also looked at the sculpture and the base from the standpoint of making sure that the integrity of the art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| and what the artist wanted is maintained on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| So we've adjusted the base a couple of feet to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| We've also eliminated one of the sidewalks that really allows us to save one of the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| that is parallel to another tree that's going to be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| And in addition to that, you folks are probably aware that there's nine additional trees that are being planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| It was in the original plan, and I understand in talking with Casey there's 13 additional trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| for a total of 22 trees that will be added to this area as opposed to one tree being cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| So, again, our goal was to see to it that the art and the trees could live in the same space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| and this is what we worked on to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| So if you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| But I just want to emphasize the fact that the art, the base, and the trees can all live together on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Mayor, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Now, Council, two other people have signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| We can move to your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| I'll make a motion to suspend our rules to allow the two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| You're making a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| I think the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Two more people get to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Brady Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Brady Watson, if there are questions for you, Mr. Grave, we'll call you back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| If Council has questions during their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Mr. Watson, please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| Yeah, I'll keep it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| And good to know Tommy doesn't want to hear from more folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| But my name is Brady Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I live at 229 Haywood Avenue, and most of what I would say has already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| And I would just encourage the city to take a rational approach to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| I think none of us here that I'm aware of are against art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| I think we all love art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| It's just this particular location that would require moving five trees seems kind of crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| especially if the art is supposed to give the appeal of you being a tree canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| So if, as Mr. Grave says, there's been a change to the plan that would allow four trees to remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| I think I would certainly be pretty supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| Of course, I hate to see any trees cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| But I think if there's a way to do this project in a way that keeps the trees, they have a lot of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| There's a project with UT right now that's looking at urban heat islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| If we remove all these trees, you're going to have a lot more heat effect downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| There are a lot of houseless folks that live down there, and they're going to have less shade to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| So there's lots of impacts of removing these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| And, of course, with climate change, we're going to see more extreme heat events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| We're going to see more flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And installing more impermeable surfaces and removing trees is going to have an adverse effect for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| So I hope we can come to an agreement in a way that allows these trees to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| and also allows this piece of art to be showcased as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| So I just hope you all will support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| And that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| The next person who signed up to speak is Harold Duckett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Harold Duckett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Harold Duckett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Is Mr. Duckett here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| Mr. Duckett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| No, he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Dr. Abramoff, you said you didn't want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| I just wanted to table myself until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| So can I speak now since there's time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| I mean, do you really have ‑‑ council members, do you want to go back and let her speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| My name is Rose Abramoff, 1811 East Glenwood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| and I'm an ecologist who studies the effect of climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and land use change on plants and soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I'll take this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| I started as a forest ecologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| and one of my main areas of study now is how urbanization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| and forest fragmentation affect plant and soil functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| So I feel like this resolution is really closely related to my area of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| I have a lot of stories about how trees touch my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| and while I'm speaking on my own behalf today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| I'd like to focus primarily on some science-based information about trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| So some citizens have already spoken about how trees provide shade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| convert carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| and protect local biodiversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| For example, 20% of the world's diversity of birds live in cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| They cool the air around them and promote physical and mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| So I just wanted to support those statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| and expand on the services that trees provide from a scientist's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| So mature trees can absorb more than 150 kilograms of carbon dioxide a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| and because of the way that they evaporate water from their leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| they can cool the air around them, as was stated previously, by tens of degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| However, I don't want us to think only about the above-ground portion of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| So trees have roots that pervade the soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| and they can intercept more than 15,000 liters of water per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| So the removal of mature tree roots and soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| and replacing that with a less absorptive or perhaps not at all pervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| for example, concrete, can exacerbate local flooding and erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| both of which are, like warmer temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| predicted to increase in the future in this region of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| Mature trees perform all of the services that I just mentioned more efficiently than young trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| and young trees have less of a chance of surviving to establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| 60 to 70% under the best of conditions, according to peer-reviewed literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| And energy is needed to remove, transport, replant, and fertilize young trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| throughout the process of getting them to establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| So the pragmatic among you may be interested to know that trees nearby to buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| can lower air conditioning and heating bills by 20 to 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| and because trees lower peak hot temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| they can cool the air on hot days that might otherwise burden our electrical grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| Even a single tree then can result in measurable energy savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| Lastly, property values are higher near green spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| due to the perceived, and I think real, improvement in the quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| So those of you who are more economically minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| may consider the financial benefit of maintaining mature urban canopies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| both from a public utility perspective, a flood prevention perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| and from the view of promoting higher real estate prices, if that's something you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| I further encourage this council to consider a vision for the future of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| that not only adapts to the heat and extreme weather projected by our climate models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| but leverages the period of rapid growth that the city is experiencing to grow smart and clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| And this can include, but is not limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| expanded green spaces, low carbon and high efficiency building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| and public transportation, lots of other great ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| that I'm sure many of you have thought about already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| And I encourage you to leverage the expertise in these topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| that exist in your local institutions to craft legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| that uses all the information and technology that we have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| to support public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| So in conclusion, urban mature trees have many benefits and almost no drawbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| and that's why I'm asking the members of the council to vote in favor of this resolution today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| and to consider ordinances in the future that preserve and promote existing green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| energy efficiency, and public health and safety generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you for making the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Council, that concludes people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Actually, I want to start with a lot of thank yous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you to you and your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| I know that you worked very hard in a very small amount of time to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| I also want to thank Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| I know that you did a lot of work as well as the Public Arts Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| There was never any disrespect or disregard for your work and the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| Times have changed, and in respect to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| it just seemed like the public process wasn't quite complete until we got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| With all the hooting and hollering that the protesters did, as Lisa said, we have a better product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| So thank you, everybody, all of the artists, the environmentalists that came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| It really surprised me how much this caught traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| I mean, I heard from all kinds of people, and I was very surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| I think what this touched was we're all concerned about climate change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| and we don't feel like we can do anything about it because it's too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| And this felt like something tangible and small that we could do something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| And I'm so appreciative that we're all in the same place of keeping the art, keeping the trees, and working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| I just wanted to thank Councilwoman Singh for bringing this resolution forward and starting this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| because I think it's an important conversation for us to have and to continue after today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| There are ordinances, I believe, that need to come forward to provide those greater protections for our mature trees in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3082)|
| 0:51:31| and I'm committed to being a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| I also want to applaud folks who showed up today, who have been reaching out to council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| because, like Councilwoman Singh just said, you taking action has had an impact, a positive impact on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3102)|
| 0:51:53| And I wanted to say to the Arts, Public Arts Committee, thank you all for your hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| because I do remember in 2019, when running for office, you had a forum for candidates running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3119)|
| 0:52:12| and this was one of the topics of that forum was our commitment to public art in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| And that day I made a commitment to public art, and I still have that commitment to public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| And I'm excited to see Knoxville invest in more public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| But I also am extremely concerned about climate change, as many are in this audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| I'm extremely concerned about our urban tree canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| You can feel a noticeable difference when you're downtown in areas where there are trees and in areas where there are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3160)|
| 0:52:48| I'm grateful for the trees in Market Square and all of the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Is someone timing me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| All of the hard work that was done to save those trees, because I know for myself, when I'm in Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| I feel like I'm walking as fast as possible to get to some shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| And so I'm grateful for that shadier part of Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| And this is how we bring about the change and create the community that we want in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| We have to get involved. We have to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| And I just want to thank everyone for speaking up and to the mayor for hearing the community and responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3202)|
| 0:53:31| Thank you. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you, Mayor. And I just want to echo what my colleagues just said in thanking everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| This is a great example of what we can achieve when we collaborate and we are willing and open to working together to find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3225)|
| 0:53:53| And so to those of you in the audience that showed up at the last meeting that have been working diligently on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| the Sierra Club, Public Arts Committee, and also Councilman Lemire and the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| and also the Design Center for being open to say, let's step back and let's take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| And being able to do it in such a timely way, I think, is very admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| So I just want to thank everyone for your diligence and also the public process that we saw in action these last two weeks to get us to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3255)|
| 0:54:25| And so I'm hopeful that we can move forward from here. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| I just do want to reiterate a couple of things that have been said as well, and to the Public Arts Committee, to Lisa Zenni,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3273)|
| 0:54:42| to Duane Greve with East Tennessee Design Center, and to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| There's an immense amount of talent and a part of that committee and investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3287)|
| 0:54:55| And I've always said, you know, public arts and art in general creates a great 360 experience for our city, the residents of our city, for the visitors of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3295)|
| 0:55:06| I do appreciate the time and effort, the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| But I just want to extend an accolade for this great committee that really invests a lot of time, effort, and is committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3311)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you. Vice Member Burda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| You know, trees and public art are a big part of a vibrant downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| And I just want to echo what my colleagues have said about thanking everyone who has come to express their desire to see trees remain in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3331)|
| 0:55:41| I think that's something that we have to continue to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| But I also want to thank the Public Arts Committee and all you've done to make sure you bring both of these pieces of a vibrant downtown together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3345)|
| 0:55:54| And I'd just like to thank the mayor and everyone who was a part of coming up with this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| I think it's just fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| And I think this gives us an opportunity, if I can get Casey Krause to come over to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| Casey, what I wanted to ask you about is this is a great opportunity, I think, for us to talk about the urban tree canopy study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| Because if we're wanting to have more urban tree canopy, working towards that study and that coming to council is a big piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| And I just wanted to give you a few minutes to be able to tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Yeah, it's great to have the opportunity to come and talk and have so many people turn out to talk about trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| You don't get this platform a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| So with the canopy study that we conducted back in 2020, we were looking at tree canopy from 2008 to 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3402)|
| 0:56:54| and looking at trends and how that all kind of came together for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| And with that information, and there are several reports available online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| but with that information, really what we were able to do is set the foundation for the next step, which is our urban forest master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3423)|
| 0:57:12| And with the assistance of Trees Knoxville right now, we are working on selecting a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| The city has allocated money within the budget for this year for that master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| Essentially, to be able to look at projects like this and see how trees can be a part of the project and decision-making process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3445)|
| 0:57:35| but also looking at setting up goals for the city to look at climate change and all these other benefits, social benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| environmental benefits, economic benefits that trees provide, and be able to kind of set the base for the next 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| and try and set benchmarks on what we need to do in order to meet these objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| And so it's exciting that we're able to kind of move forward, and I appreciate the mayor for helping fund that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3475)|
| 0:58:04| and my colleagues at Trees Knoxville for bringing a lot of support to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| And so we're going to need lots of people in this room to be part of that process and contribute to that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| and we want to hear from folks on how to move this urban forestry program forward and think about trees for the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you, Casey. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| And then, Lisa Zenni, while you were giving your remarks, I know you ran out of time, and I'll run out of time pretty soon myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3508)|
| 0:58:40| But what you were mentioning, and I think you just ran out of time in mentioning, is we have oftentimes heard about the price for public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3520)|
| 0:58:51| And this is a great example of wanting to have a great piece of art and saving over six years to be able to afford to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3531)|
| 0:59:06| So it was not a one-time allocation from a budget. It was saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| And I can't think of a better way to approach something that's more responsible than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| So I know you got cut off, so I want to make sure we got that point out. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor, Councilmember Ryder, then Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| Yeah, so my colleagues have had lots of great comments. I'm not going to repeat those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| I'm glad that we've resolved some of the concerns that we've heard throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| I have a question for either – I don't know if it's the administration or Lisa Zenni or Duane Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3577)|
| 0:59:47| What is the process moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Where is the plan in terms of how the rest of it gets laid out, how the plaques and the namesake of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3590)|
| 0:59:59| or the Cradle Country music moniker, sticks with the park and is honored in that fashion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| I know in speaking with Lisa Zenni, this project, the artists that were selected, the finalists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| Ms. Zenni explained how they came here during big years, and that was a big component of how the project was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| for those who were in the running for the final project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| So I just want to make sure that our musical legacy is included now that that's assured to be in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| So I just want some public assurance and know where we are in the process for those being incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Well, I'll say for the record in response that the name is staying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| The trees are staying, except for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| We're going to add another 20-some trees, and the plaques and history is going to be not just staying the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| but preserved and displayed in a new way that I think will be more likely for people to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| But David Brace, do you have some more details to add to that at this juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| No, I think, Councilwoman, the plaques are safely stored and have been stored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| knowing that they would be reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| And we have hired, we have a landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| In addition to the artist, that landscape architect will work with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| and with Ms. Zenni and the Public Arts Committee to evaluate where those plaques are placed back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| so that we can honor the legacy of music in our city and address any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| just from an equity perspective what has happened on that corner and down towards the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I appreciate the public commitment, and I know I had a conversation with Lisa about it last Friday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| And I'll just say for Councilmembers, the Public Arts Committee did meet earlier this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| and I shared this updated recommendations from the Design Center with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| and they did vote to approve it and, you know, asked that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| So you asked about the timing of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| You know, I'm hopeful that maybe Councilmember Singh will choose to withdraw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| because we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We don't have to delay six months because we already have a path forward that is meeting the goals of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| So that's something I hope we can do this evening is move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| You were sort of getting at my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| So at this point, if we like what we've heard and we don't have this resolution withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| then a vote against this resolution moves the process forward as described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| with one tree coming down, all those other trees being planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| and a design process in place to display the plaques and the name of the park is staying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you again, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| So, yes, we've all worked really hard for a compromise, and I have no issue in withdrawing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| I have a few concerns that I want to make sure we continue to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| It sounds like we're moving in that direction with the music aspects to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| and, you know, I've received the plans right before the meeting, so everything's on paper, which feels good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3790)|
| 1:03:19| So I make a motion to withdraw this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Okay. Motion made to withdraw has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| Any further discussion, Councilmember Singh or Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| My light was on earlier, so I'll wait until we go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Actually, we won't go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Well, if the motion to withdraw passes, then it's been withdrawn and we'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3824)|
| 1:04:00| Well, I just have the same concerns as everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| I'm happy to hear that Councilmember Singh has plans, but that was another question I had was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| I support the resolution tonight to postpone because I don't have all of those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3852)|
| 1:04:21| You know, sometimes we might get an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| I think it's in your mailbox, your council mailbox, because there's a lot of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| Oh, these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Yeah, we presented a summary of the vision, a summary of the public process, their original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3872)|
| 1:04:41| and I know that Vice Mayor Roberto had asked for the procurement documents, which we're collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| But you have the latest documents, and that is what was placed in the council box and on your desk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| And that's what the Public Arts Committee reviewed earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| And from this, would the public be able to understand which tree is marked for removal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| The one that's in red is the only one that's not going to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| So the site plan that the mayor presented tonight is not in that packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| but we, Mayor, can upload that to the website so that the public can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| I know that Mr. Greave and Ms. Zinni both have copies as well, and so we can place that online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| and we could work with Ms. Farley to do a media advisory and get it out to the public and to all of the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| if that would help get the word out about saving these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And is there a mock-up already of where the plaques will be placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| Again, I think there's a landscape design company that's already been engaged to plan that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| I don't think they've shared their plan because there's still been some moving elements to it that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| we've changed things just as recently as today, so we can't have her move forward until that's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| But she's done great work in designing parks and public spaces throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| and I'm confident she will do the same here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| For me, I would feel more comfortable if we had even an amended resolution with a shorter pause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3972)|
| 1:06:21| but still a pause just so that we can get all of these details in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| because I do think this is the moment to get it right and make sure there weren't any misunderstandings at today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| But, you know, that's my only hesitation. I think things are headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| I would just feel more comfortable if there were at least, you know, a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| so that we can have a clear understanding of what the plan is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| Council Member Parker, I understand your apprehension, and two weeks ago I learned if it's not guaranteed and in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| you don't know what to expect, so I did get the plans beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| I understand if you would feel more comfortable looking at them before voting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| but I feel comfortable with that we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| Okay. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| I just want to say I've got a little bit of concerns as well because, you know, I just saw these plans this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| but the consensus seems to be that there's a lot of confidence in the discussions that's been happening with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| and the Arts Council and various people, so I wouldn't disagree with Council Person Singh's decision to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4059)|
| 1:07:50| But having said that, I still want to monitor this as it develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| and all of the council should be kept abreast of how it develops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| and what actual steps are taken in the implementation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| So this is something that I will continue to monitor as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| And just briefly, I wanted to say that I'm really proud of where we've come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| as far as an awareness over the years of the environment and tree canopies and climate change and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4098)|
| 1:08:27| and it's good to hear from all my colleagues and all the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| that there seems to be a consensus and an awareness of just how serious this problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| The other thing I did want to underline just a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| because I'm not sure it's quite getting enough traction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| and that is a little bit more of an emphasis on me on keeping at Country Music Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| and highlighting the history of the music and the contributions that country music people have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| people of color have made, and it could possibly be a really good performance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| and you know you've got the WDVX right at the corner there with the Blue Plate Special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| and hopefully there will be some kind of synergy going there between musicians and artists that can use that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| So I'm really happy that there seems to be a very reasonable compromise here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| so kudos to all those that have made this happen so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| You know, I won't be happy until I see the end of it, but so far so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| I just want to add one comment and one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| You know, we have ambitious climate goals, and every tree counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| and every bit of carbon that we reduce is important, so thank you to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| I just want to add on to what everybody said, the groups of people that came together to make this kind of agreement possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| I do have one question as it relates to seeing this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| I think this body has oversight of funding to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| so Mr. Brace, in terms of us making sure the plans proposed to us a few hours ago get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| this body will approve funding for the installation of the art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Yes, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| So there's two contracts that have already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| One is the design contract for the landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| The other is the contract with the artist in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| So we are actually in the period where we're receiving bids for the construction of the plinth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| which, again, is a component of the art itself within that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| So we will bring those bids and a contract for construction before this body for approval, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| probably in 45 to 60 days depending on the bid work that goes into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| There were a number of questions from the prequalified bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| So this body will have oversight of that last step of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| There were some bids that were supposed to go out tomorrow, February 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| Is that still occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| So we prequalified because of the design of this plinth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| It is not necessarily a design that we would bid out through a traditional low bid number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4279)|
| 1:11:28| So we did an RFQ, request for qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| So we asked people to approve that they could actually construct this unique plinth art component to this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| And so we prequalified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| I believe we had two individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Mr. King is here from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| The prequalified contractors then received the specifications from our engineering team that we helped design, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| and support through the artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| So they are actually bidding on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| So we had a pre-bid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Then there was a window where they have asked questions, and we are responding to those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| and we will provide them with an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| Then they will provide their bids to the city engineering department, who will then evaluate those bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| And ideally, we would come before this body and then have a contract be approved by city council to start construction of the basin of plinth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| The artist is building the art piece in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| So there are already contractors approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| Are they going to be needing to make changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Actually, I don't want to get into the details of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| We will vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| But what I do want to be and am concerned about is that we had so many people come together and collaborate, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| and we have a better product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| So I hope that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| There were students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| There were young people, old people, those of us in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| I hope that there are still many stakeholders involved as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| The motion on the floor is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Okay, moving on to Item 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| 11B is a resolution affirming that all city residents should have the right to access to fundamental obstetric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| and gynecological health care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Council Members, we have some people signed up to speak on this item, starting with Dr. Nikki Zeit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4406)|
| 1:13:33| Dr. Zeit, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Please state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4418)|
| 1:13:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| I'm Nikki Zeit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| My address is 1928 Alcoa Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| I've been an OB-GYN in Knoxville since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| As an OB-GYN, I take care of women from their first period through menopause and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| I've delivered thousands of babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| In fact, it's very likely that I've either delivered someone here or been in the room for someone delivering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I can't go to Lakeshore Park without someone saying, are you Dr. Zeit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| You probably don't remember this, but you delivered the kiddo playing third base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Those are the good days, the really good days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| But as an OB-GYN, I also take care of women when pregnancies go wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| and sometimes that means terminating pregnancy, performing an abortion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| Anyone that says there's never a reason to end a pregnancy to save a woman's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| has not practiced OB-GYN in a busy hospital that serves a referral center for medical complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| I have, in Chicago, in Memphis, and in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| And I know abortion is a reality of reproductive health care, even if people don't talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| Despite what you may have heard, it is an abortion if it's performed after the rape of a 12-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| It is an abortion even if the pregnancy could not survive on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| And I've been that doctor, helping those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| I've performed those abortions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| But those situations are now illegal in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| I would be a criminal if I performed an abortion in those situations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| Since June 28th in Tennessee, we've been unable to end pregnancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| where the baby does not have a brain or kidneys or has other life-limiting abnormalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| A doctor from Memphis called me last week and asked me what she was able to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| her patient who had a 19-week pregnancy with no brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| I said she could tell her exactly what she had told her before June 28th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| because there's no gag order in these laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| But that now, if the patient or her family chose to end that pregnancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| which many in that situation would, she would have to travel out of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| She would endure the cost, the delay, the inconvenience because of the no-exception abortion ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| The patient was devastated, and the physician was angry on behalf of her patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| But that patient was lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| and went to Illinois to have an abortion and start her healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| Many women will not have that option and will be forced to continue these pregnancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| and go through the risks and pain of childbirth to leave the hospital empty-handed and brokenhearted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4584)|
| 1:16:32| Since August 25th, it's also a felony to end a pregnancy where the water has broken before 22 weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| and the immature lungs will never develop enough to breathe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| despite the increased risk to the woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Cases like this have changed abortion laws in Ireland, Argentina, Colombia, and other countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| But across the United States, women's lives are being threatened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| because doctors are afraid to intervene until it's clear that the mom is very sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| or that there's no fetal heartbeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| This delay in care is at odds with how I was trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| and what all the OB-GYN professional organizations recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| And it's now happening across Tennessee because physicians fear criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| Prior to August 2022, I ended pregnancies after cardiologists, neurologists, nephrologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| oncologists, and other medical specialists called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| We discussed the medical situation, and the patient and her family decided it was what was needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| Now, if someone disagrees with my medical decision-making and charges me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| I have to defend myself with the preponderance of evidence in front of a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| Many of my colleagues are afraid of losing their licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| afraid of being unable to practice medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| and in a field that is already fraught with stress and burnout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| many are talking about stopping obstetrics or leaving Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| This legislation is clearly causing immeasurable consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| I've heard many say that the law was only intended to stop outpatient elective abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| not to take away all reproductive health care options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| But closing places like Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| has caused a trusted location for my patients needing abortion care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| when insurance would not pay, even if the case was for a life-limiting abnormality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| to afford compassionate care in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| There is a potential good consequence of this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| the increased demand for highly effective contraception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| As long as the people can afford the option that's best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I worry that young women are considering permanent contraception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| because they fear pregnancy so much in a state where they don't have protected bodily autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| Equitable access to highly effective contraception is the way to decrease the need for abortion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| Making abortion illegal does not decrease the need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| it only makes it less safe and more challenging to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| Please vote to approve this resolution and send a message to the Tennessee legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| to fix this law before more women suffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| and we are unable to keep and recruit OBGYNs to our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4753)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Next person to sign up to speak is Wendy Bach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| You can start by saying your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Good evening, my name is Wendy Bach and I live at 900 Grodd Street in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| and I'm also a professor of law at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| It is my privilege to speak today in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| Much of my scholarship focuses on the criminalization of health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| From that vantage point, I want to spend the next few minutes talking about two topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| First, what is likely to happen in terms of criminal prosecution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| and the impact on health care in light of the trigger ban we just heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| and what the city of Knoxville might do to mitigate the effects of this horrible law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| First, although the initial focus in response to the trigger ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| has rightly been on the possibility that health care providers will be prosecuted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| there is no question that the prosecutions will go beyond those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| Nationally, since 1973, scholars, activists, and reporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| have collectively documented over 1,700 prosecutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| and other forced legal interventions brought against women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| based on their reproductive conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| These prosecutions have targeted almost exclusively poor women and women of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| I have no doubt that in Tennessee we will ultimately see those prosecutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| against low-income people, against parents, friends, counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| and possibly against pregnant individuals themselves for their reproductive conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| When we criminalize health care decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| it impacts both access to and the quality of health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| Here, the immediate impact is stark and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| Pregnant people needing basic reproductive health care will not access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| But beyond that stark reality, there is a clear impact on doctors and patients, as we have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| As we have heard from Dr. Zeit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| reproductive health care providers whose sole job is to provide health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| to their patients now find themselves in impossible situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| fearing prosecution for doing their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| The trigger ban includes some affirmative defenses that might apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| The physician can prove that she had a good faith belief that she had to perform the abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| for example, to save the life of the mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| But it is impossible for physicians not to hesitate, not to wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| am I going to be prosecuted if I provide health care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| This is quite simply unconscionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| While the clear effect on patients' access to care is devastating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| the effects go far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I want to bring you just for a moment to the words of another woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| whose pregnancy was criminalized in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| This time, because several years ago, Tennessee was prosecuting women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| for fetal assault or in utero transmission of narcotics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| One woman, in response to a question about how the law impacted her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| said the laws, in effect, prevented it from being a care issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| It became a law, a liability issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| In response to that law, women stopped seeking reproductive care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| for fear they would be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Here, too, for women who experience pregnancy complications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| the possibility of prosecution of themselves or their loved ones is all too real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| There's no question women will stop seeking care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| While it is certainly true that the city of Knoxville cannot change state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| on their own, there is much this body can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| First, the city can put policies in place to deprioritize investigation and prosecution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| and second, it can devote resources to ensuring that families in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| have full access to legal reproductive health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| One of the most devastating consequences of laws like these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| is the way that policing and prosecution impacts care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| Police and prosecutors regularly demand health care records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| health care providers provide those records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| and the contents of medical files form the basis for prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| It is entirely within the city's power to mitigate these harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| by creating protocols limiting KPD's ability to seek reproductive health care information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| In addition, although HIPAA is not perfect, it does provide protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| and the city could advertise those protections and assist individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| in filing complaints should federal law be violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| Knoxville can also become a model for ensuring access to high-quality reproductive care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| both through its own initiatives and through funding organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| that are already providing reproductive care in Knoxville's poor communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| The city can provide resources to its employees to access full reproductive care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| It could also establish a reproductive maternal and child health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| that would make information about how to access the full range of reproductive care widely available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| and ensure access to comprehensive family planning services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| particularly in poor communities that are likely to be most impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| I thank you for your time and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| and would be happy to provide additional information should that be of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5072)|
| 1:24:47| The next person signed up to speak is Reverend Lauren Bogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Reverend Bogle, you can start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| I am Reverend Laura Bogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| I live at 234 East Oklahoma Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| I have served for the last ten years the Foothills Unitarian Universalist Fellowship at Maribel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| and have lived in Knoxville these last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Tonight I am wearing a shirt that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| Everyone Loves Someone Who Had an Abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| to remind us that when we talk about reproductive health care, including abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5122)|
| 1:25:32| we are talking about real people, people we know and love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| whether they have ever shared their story with us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| As a minister, I am privileged to accompany people through all aspects of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| from birth to death, through joyful times and the most painful times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| through making difficult and complicated ethical decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| including whether to end a pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| It is my faith that calls me here to ask your support of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| the Abortion is Health Care Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Despite what we are often led to believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| there are deeply faithful and morally grounded people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5173)|

| 1:26:25| My faith teaches me that all of life is sacred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| that every person has an inherent worth and dignity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| and that women can and should be trusted to make decisions that impact their bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| their future, and their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5200)|
| 1:26:49| Because life is so sacred, bringing a child into this world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| should be under free, intentional, and thoughtful conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| At the core of every religious tradition, including my own, is the call to love and compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5220)|
| 1:27:08| And justice is how love is expressed in the public square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5228)|
| 1:27:16| Young people, people of color, and poor people will bear the brunt of Tennessee's abortion ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| Not because they have more unwanted pregnancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| but because, as we all in this room know, when you have less money, you have fewer choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5248)|
| 1:27:36| Reproductive justice means not only supporting access to abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| but also working to reduce unwanted pregnancies by offering comprehensive sexuality education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5261)|
| 1:27:49| as well as supporting economic and social policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| that ensure all families have the resources they need to care for the children they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| If our state legislators are not willing to also commit to these kinds of social and economic policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5280)|
| 1:28:13| then they truly have no interest in reducing abortions or upholding the sacredness of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| They are simply seeking to control the lives of women and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| And this council has the opportunity to make different choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5305)|
| 1:28:34| and set different social and economic policies for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Tonight, I also want to speak personally and let you know that I am also here as the adoptive mother of three daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| Three children with uteruses who could become pregnant someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5326)|

| 1:29:14| and girls, not women, girls pregnant, victims of rape or abuse, incest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| having to travel and fight for the mental and physical care they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5361)|

| 1:29:32| people trained to care for the people of our city being targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5372)|

| 1:29:43| I close with these words from Unitarian Minister Edward Everett Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| I am only one, but still I am one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I cannot do everything, but still I can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| And because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| While I know this council can't change the decision of the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| and I know that on your own you can't change the laws of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| still you can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| Thank you for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5416)|

| 1:30:33| The next person signed up to speak is Reverend John Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| Reverend Gill, please start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I'm Reverend John Gill, pastor of Church of the Savior, United Church of Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| on 934 White Scarborough Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| Excuse me just a second, Reverend Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Mr. Johnson reminded me that your rules say that you can have three for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| and three against and a total of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| We have eight people signed up altogether, and they're all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| So council members wish to make a motion to suspend the rules and allow everyone to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Okay, motion made to suspend the rules and allow all eight speakers to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| Reverend Gill, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| I'm Reverend John Gill, pastor of Church of the Savior, United Church of Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| 934 White Scarborough Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| I'm also the father of two daughters who currently live in fear of losing their freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| when it comes to reproductive health in this state and in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| And I'm here to speak in support of this city council resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| and I'm grateful to Mayor Kincannon and to the city council for taking this issue up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| and for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| For many decades, my denomination, the United Church of Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| and other like-minded denominations, as we just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| have supported a woman's right to freedom of choice when it comes to her own personal medical care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| and access to safe, comprehensive, reproductive health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| with a full range of options, including abortion, if she so chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| As a pastor, I often work with congregation members who are wrestling with difficult personal decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| things like whether to end medical intervention for a loved one who is unconscious with no hope of recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| whether to end a marriage that is unsafe or unhealthy for them or their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| and sometimes whether or not to end a pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| For any number of reasons, many of which are spelled out very well in the resolution before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| In my experience working with people in these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| these kinds of decisions are deeply personal, complicated, and never easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| For this reason, they are decisions that need to be left to those who are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| based on their own faith and values, health concerns, and life circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| Do any of us really believe the state should be in the middle of such difficult family decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| or that the blunt instrument of some legislative statute can take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| all of the life circumstances and health concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| that are involved in trying to make the best possible decision about whether to end a pregnancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| There's a story in the New Testament about an angry crowd with stones in their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| ready to kill a woman accused of adultery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| because that's what the blunt instrument of the law demanded at that time and place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| The man involved was nowhere to be found, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| which just tells you that some things never change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| For the crowd, the issue was clear cut because that's what the law said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| But Jesus of Nazareth didn't see it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| And kneeling down to think things over, he stood up after a while and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| let the one who has not sinned, who has not erred, cast the first stone upon this woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| The stones were dropped and the crowd dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| Unfortunately, women's reproductive health care has been turned into a shallow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| overly simplistic political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| We seem to like things simple, it's either this way or that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| but the most important decisions in our lives are never simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| and require the kind of careful consideration and human compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| that only those involved can give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| especially when it comes to something as deeply personal to women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| as their own health, their own bodies, and a pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| Women deserve the right to make their own best decision about what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| I support this city council resolution because it recognizes the many personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| ethical, health, and social justice dimensions of abortion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| and simply asks the state to stay out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| Allow women to make their own decisions about their own lives, bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| and reproductive health care. That seems pretty basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| Please vote in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| The women in our lives and in our community deserve that respect and that freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| And let anyone who has not confronted such important and difficult personal decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| in their own lives dare to cast the first stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you for your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5713)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you. Next person signed up to speak is Greg Kaplan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| Mr. Kaplan, if you could approach the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| Thank you, Mayor Kincaid, and thank you, city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| My name is Greg Kaplan. I live at 3844 Woodhill Place, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| My wife, Nuria, and I have lived here for 27 years in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| and we are both professors of Spanish at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Nuria and I live in Sequoia Hills, just around the corner from council member Janet Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| and our son Andrew graduated this year from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| We are Knoxvillians by choice and proud of our city and county and state in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5784)|
| 1:36:33| We are also proud to be associated with our great university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| which means so much to our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| However, there is a dark cloud hanging over Tennessee, which this resolution seeks to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5801)|
| 1:36:50| This cloud is government intervention in the lives of women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5810)|
| 1:37:01| And on one of the most personal decisions women make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| Choice has been banned in Tennessee for women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| There are zero exceptions to the law in Tennessee. Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| Even if a doctor determines that a woman's life is in danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| that doctor risks being criminally charged for taking the steps needed to save the woman's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| Doctors should not be put in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| And of course, women should not be put in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| Women need to know that their doctors are free to give them the best medical advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| particularly if their lives are at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| Victims of rape and incest in Tennessee should not be forced to carry the children of their abusers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| And government should not impose its will upon women in such circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5876)|
| 1:38:09| The truth is, these are complicated matters that are best left up to the women involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| their doctors, their faith, and those whose guidance the women seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| I hope that the vote tonight is unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| That would send a strong signal to the legislature and to our governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| that Tennessee's third largest city wants government to stay out of the lives of Tennessee women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5911)|
| 1:38:47| I thank Councilmember Singh for bringing this resolution forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5927)|

| 1:39:09| I am a candidate for state representative from the west and south of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| Should I be elected on November 8th, it would be my honor to take a copy of this resolution to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5956)|
| 1:39:26| to share with my future colleagues of both parties and with the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| This is not just another resolution by our city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| It is a resolution that speaks to one of the most significant domestic issues today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| and one that impacts the women who constitute the majority of our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| Every one of these women, not the state government, deserves to make their own personal choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=5992)|

| 1:40:20| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6020)|
| 1:40:28| Hi, good evening. My name is Chloe Akers, and my address is 618 South Gay Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| I had something written down, but I do better when I don't follow my script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| I've been a criminal defense attorney for 14 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| seven of which has been spent here, just down the hallway in criminal courtrooms in Division I, II, and III in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| I defend clients. I defend the accused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| I believe in social justice. I believe in transparency, and I believe in accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| I'm also the very proud aunt of identical twin boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| Many people behind me have probably seen some of my Instagram videos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| and they've heard me speak, and they might wonder why I care so deeply about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| My nephews, who just started kindergarten at Sequoia Elementary, were able to attend their first day of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| because they were able to live through a high-risk pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| My sister, my best friend, my life partner, my soulmate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| she is also alive to take them to their first day of kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| because she was treated by two of the best perinatologists in this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| who made sure that her identical twins were delivered safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| I remember the day my sister told my mother she was pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| We captured it on video and tried to get it produced on the Today Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| I remember the look on my mother's face when she realized my sister was pregnant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| and there were two bibs in this box that we gave my mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| And when she took the second bib out and she screamed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| twins? My sister said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| And I remember the look on my mother's face when she realized that she was having twins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| And then the look on her face when she realized her baby, my sister,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| was now carrying a high-risk pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| It was one of those moments in life where I realized that pregnancy is this strange state of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| simultaneously between utter and abject fear and true joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| The law that was passed in Tennessee is staggeringly broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| It criminalizes the medical procedure of the termination of any pregnancy for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| without exception, even in cases where it's necessary to save the life of the mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| Make no mistake, there are no exceptions to this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| There's been a lot of chatter recently about whether or not we need to worry about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| because it might not really be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| As a criminal defense attorney, I can tell you that misses the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| It's not about whether the law can be enforced or will be enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| it's the threat that it could be enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| because, ladies and gentlemen, that's all it takes to hesitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| That's why we have criminal laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| We want you to deter conduct before it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| The problem here is that that conduct is medical care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| and that hesitation can cause women to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6206)|
| 1:43:36| That hesitation could have caused my sister to die, to not know the joy of my nephews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| What got my family through those rough nine months and what got my sister through that pregnancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| was the knowledge that her medical team had every tool at its disposal to keep her alive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| and to keep those boys alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| I ask you to pass this resolution so that every other citizen of Knoxville can have that same opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| to feel that joy and tackle that fear without also wondering if they might die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| because this law causes their doctor to do what human beings do in the face of criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| Hesitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| We don't have that kind of time when you're treating a high-risk pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| Ironically, the name of the legislation was the Tennessee Human Life Protection Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6262)|
| 1:44:30| Council members, this law does not protect life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| This law threatens life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| I just hope we can change it before it takes a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| I believe this resolution is an important first step in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| I encourage you to pass it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6287)|
| 1:45:00| Next person signed up to speak is Zachary Thurber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6300)|
| 1:45:12| You can start by stating your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| My name is Zachary Owen Thurber, and my address is 3165 Washington Ridgeway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| I'm a student at the University of Tennessee, and I would like to share why this resolution is important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| by talking about my disability and how it shows why abortion is health care and should be affirmed as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| I have epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| Those seizures have impacted my life tremendously and held me back in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Through medication, I have been able to regain a sense of normality in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| The journey to find a medication that works was hard, as it always tends to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| One of the medications I tried had such bad side effects that I spent an entire week in and out of sleep only on my bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| Another one of the medications I had tried was virtually useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| I was having just as many seizures on it as I was off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| But I did eventually find success with the medication I am on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| and I am very grateful for my neurologist and the ability to get the medication with insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| It is very good that I found a medication that works for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| because when you're in a state where medication is not controlling your seizures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| you lose a good bit of your ability to live life independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| Not even considering the risks seizures themselves bring to your safety and well-being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| you cannot drive up to six months after your last seizure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| You cannot go swimming due to the risk of drowning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| You must constantly be alert and avoid the things that could trigger you, which is near impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| If you go to school or work a job, it is likely you will have to call out constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| due to the inability to get there and stay there safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| Epilepsy really screws with your life when it's not controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| My first semester at UTU was spent at home, because I could not go to school at all, because I couldn't drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| But what does this have to do with abortion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| Everything, because abortion is health care and epilepsy is a health problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| Epilepsy increases the risk of birth defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| Pregnancy increases the risks of seizures you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| And pregnancy makes the severity of the seizures worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| All of this is especially worse for those who already do not have regulated seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| And the medication I was talking about earlier that is responsible for allowing me to live normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| also causes birth defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Some epileptics are ending up pregnant, forced to decide whether to have a baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| that may not even make it five minutes after it's born,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| knowing that they are the ones that put them in that position through the medication that they rely on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| or to put their normal life on pause, risking constant danger for nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| because they choose to sacrifice their well-being to maintain a pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| And for the epileptics that haven't found success with medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| pregnancy is a potential death sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| All of those options suck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| But those are the only options when abortion is not considered health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| I am lucky I will not have to endure a forced pregnancy where I am stuck with those choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| but I can sympathize with how impossible that decision would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| I know what it is like to suffer from this disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| and to have your life flipped on its head because of seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| People should never, ever be forced to endure those struggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| because of the misguided idea that abortion is not health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| Not when it could be avoided. Not when we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| People like me do not deserve to have their health and well-being dismissed because of a pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| No one deserves to have their health and well-being dismissed because of a pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| Abortion is health care, abortion saves lives, and we need to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6516)|
| 1:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| Next person signed up to speak is Leticia Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| You can come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| Good evening. My name is Leticia Flores, and my address is 609 Union Avenue, zip code 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6547)|
| 1:49:15| So thank you for giving me the opportunity to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| I volunteer with the Tennessee Equality Project, which is a nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| which advocates for the civil rights of LGBTQ plus people in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| I'm also a psychologist, and I'm also an ally and an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| So thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| I want to draw your attention to the parts of the resolution stating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| eliminating legal access to abortion dramatically increases the health and mortality risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| within low-income communities and communities of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| and that eliminating legal access to abortion can increase the health and mortality risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| within these low-income communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| A group not mentioned here but often a part of these communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| and equally vulnerable to increased health and mortality risk is the LGBTQ plus community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| I'm here to speak on their behalf as an ally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| In addition to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors that can make it difficult to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| reproductive health care, the stigma and explicit discrimination that many LGBTQ plus people experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| add to their health care burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| I hear regularly from members of the community who have negative interactions with medical providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| They subsequently avoid getting necessary and important regular reproductive care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| and may hesitate or delay obtaining care when urgent needs arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| such as pregnancies with high medical risk or pregnancy due to a sexual assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| The need for culturally competent medical providers is significant in the best of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| and these are not the best of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| Today, supportive providers, as we've already heard from numerous people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| fear losing their licenses when they help someone terminate a pregnancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| just as they fear losing their licenses when they provide affirming care to trans and non-binary youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| which might involve providing reproductive health care to a male-identified individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| The link between controlling reproductive health care and controlling gender-affirming care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| may sound odd to your ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| but the explosion of anti-trans bills restricting or banning outright gender-affirming care for minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| and the proliferation of anti-abortion legislation stem from similar sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| such as the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a conservative organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| that has been shown to draft anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion briefs and bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| and distribute them across the country to legislators like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| This year has also seen a spate of incidents where children's hospitals in Boston and Ohio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| and their medical staff have been harassed and threatened by another influential conservative group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| after being falsely accused of providing hysterectomies to trans and non-binary identified minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6718)|
| 1:52:06| Such campaigns serve to conflate and confuse safe, standard medical procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6726)|
| 1:52:14| They're confusing them and they're calling them abusive and dangerous, quote, mutilations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| Legislative supporters state that these reproductive health restricting laws and measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| outlying gender-affirming care for minors, as well as these abortion laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| are merely to protect girls and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| Parental rights are touted as supreme unless the parent supports their child's need to terminate a pregnancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| or their child's need to begin hormone replacement therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| These laws only serve to take away agency from girls and women in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| and once again, they erase our trans and non-binary friends and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| We do not need to be infantilized. We do not need to be desexualized or protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| If you provide us with the tools, the resources, and the freedom for good reproductive care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| we can take care of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Supported self-sufficiency is the East Tennessee way, I have learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| Let the physicians do their jobs and support them as they learn to do it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| with more education with their LGBTQ patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| We will have a healthier, happier, and freer city, county, and state as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6808)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you. Thank you very much to all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| and I just wanted to say for the record I wholeheartedly agree with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| I appreciate everyone who helped bring it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| I think abortion is health care, and I trust women to make their own health care decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6835)|
| 1:54:12| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| I'm a husband and a father of two adult daughters, and I'm thinking of them in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| I'm supporting this resolution because I believe all women have the right to make decisions about their own health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6861)|
| 1:54:29| And I want to thank everyone who came tonight to speak to this important measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| I'm grateful for Greg Kaplan coming tonight, for his thoughtful and passionate remarks this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| Council's resolution tonight will not change state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| That's up to our representatives in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| And I hope you will continue to advocate for this with those folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6889)|
| 1:55:00| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| I also want to thank the speakers that spoke this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| Very insightful and impactful words, and those supporters that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| and also my colleague who brought this resolution to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| I also want to say that I appreciate the people who have reached out to council members in opposition via e-mail or phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6917)|
| 1:55:25| because their opinion matters as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| What I do want to say is that I also agree that politics has no place in health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6928)|
| 1:55:36| As Vice Mayor Roberto stated, this city council, we are powerless to change the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| but I do want to applaud those who do stand in the statehouse and advocate for the rights for women to have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6943)|
| 1:55:52| And I know that we have one state representative here this evening, Gloria Johnson, if you will stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6959)|
| 1:56:06| I know in a lot of our e-mails that it was stated that the people spoke overwhelmingly at the state when this law was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6966)|
| 1:56:16| and also in the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| I also disagree with that because there's always two sides to every issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| and even though the people that are sitting here today who are opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| we did not have the representation because I also agree to be able to override that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| We do need to always uplift those people who do fight for those things that we do believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| So thank you all, and thank you to my colleagues who brought this resolution forward, and I'm pleased to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7002)|
| 1:56:51| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to all the members of the community who have joined us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7013)|
| 1:57:00| who have e-mailed and reached out to us on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| This resolution is an important one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| Reproductive health care is an issue that I've worked on in this city and others for several years as a community organizer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7028)|
| 1:57:20| and human rights advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| And as a student at UT, there were times when this issue came up that the response was so intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7042)|
| 1:57:32| that I could not have imagined 25 years ago a resolution like this passing through Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7052)|
| 1:57:40| in a room full of supporters of that resolution and no opposition signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| although we did receive e-mails, but no opposition signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| So I'm so proud of my city today, because this is not something I would have imagined before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7069)|
| 1:58:00| We've spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| I just wanted you all to know a lot of work went into pulling this resolution together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| I think we've worked on it for almost six weeks, trying to figure out what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| and I feel that there is more that this city can do, and I want to be a part of that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| We're limited, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| We're quite limited, and we have a lot of work to do at the state level to ensure those in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7100)|
| 1:58:28| who are able to get pregnant will have access to that health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| So I just wanted to thank my fellow colleagues who signed on to cosponsor it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| and again, thank you all for showing up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7120)|
| 1:58:51| I don't want to belabor a lot of the points that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| I appreciate the support and everybody speaking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| We did receive e-mails and messages in both directions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7136)|
| 1:59:02| I want to echo a couple of the comments that were made, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| For me personally, it's very important that we have medical care in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| Our city is only as healthy and is only able to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7153)|
| 1:59:19| and continue being a good place to live if we have medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| When you start creating an environment where physicians who are trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| nurses who are trained can't make medical decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| what you're going to see is people not coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| And if you research that, you'll see that's already going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| And we're one of the top states where people are hesitating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| and are not wanting to come here to practice medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| If you don't know what that means, I'll be happy to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| I live in a household where people, some of you may be in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| who are constantly reaching out to me trying to figure out how to get a medical appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| with a specialist who's booked out a particular practice that's booked out over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| because we cannot recruit enough people in that specialty and other specialties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| Some folks may believe that this is a choice issue and they may see it differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7212)|
| 2:00:18| but I have to urge our state legislators to really examine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| what they're doing for health care in this city and this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| and the danger that we put people in when they can't get obstetrics care, gynecological care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| which is going to ripple through and become care for cancer and other specialties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7233)|
| 2:00:40| The practitioners will choose not to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| I know that because we came from another state and I know people who have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| and I hear stories of people who aren't coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| So I hope that our state legislators will hear us on that because we can't function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| We can't go to work as healthy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| We can't maintain our city and our lives if we don't have health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| We depend upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| And so for me, that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| One component of it is to make sure that we have health care moving forward for everyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| And the last thing I'll say is my husband asked me when Roe got overturned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| if I was personally worried for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| And I'm like, no, I'm not upset for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| I don't really have worries in this aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| I'm a little old. I'm getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| I can pay my way to get to the states far away to get care if I needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| But there's a lot of people who can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| They don't have that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| And there's a lot of reasons that someone would need abortion care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| I will very much echo what Dr. Zeit said, who I think may not be here with us any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| She's on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| I hope she's delivering someone's baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| She was not on call the night that I delivered, though she was my obstetrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| Was handed off to one of her fabulous colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| Sorry, I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| Anyway, there are a lot of reasons that you could need this kind of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| And if you have not walked a mile or ten in a physician's shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| you should sit down with them and understand all the reasons they might need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| a patient might need this care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| And the last thing I'll say on that is we have laws like HIPAA in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| and for some reason your health care is personal until all of a sudden it becomes a political football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7350)|
| 2:02:37| And I hate to see the way that this has flipped and is tearing our country apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| And in turn, we end up potentially being a state that doesn't have access to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| So I hope that we can get sensible legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| And the last thing I'll say is our legislators have already spoken up that they didn't quite get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| For those who emailed us to say that they got it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| they've already acknowledged there's a news story on WBR that they didn't get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| They've got to go back and fix what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Because they have criminalized all abortion care for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| There are no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| And at the very minimum, they must fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Or we all will be left with no care, no obstetrical care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| and no other care potentially rippling from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7408)|
| 2:03:35| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| There are parts of this resolution that I feel are reasonable and that I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| But abortion is not a black and white issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| It is complex, and you will find people from every walk of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| every political stance, every religious affiliation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| whose positions vary and individually fall in a hundred different places along the spectrum of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| It is a heavy issue, and no one can pretend to understand others' life experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| or personal journeys to know how or why they have landed on their own moral compass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7454)|
| 2:04:20| and school of thought where abortion is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| It is not for any of us to judge or villainize someone's belief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| nor is it as simple as putting people in pro-choice versus pro-life buckets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| A deeper dive will only prove the myriad of definitions, realities, and perspectives that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7475)|
| 2:04:43| I've worked with the largest national nonprofit for child sex abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| and seen the horrific and long-term trauma many of those children go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| I'm a cancer survivor, and I've met many women along my journey who were diagnosed while pregnant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7492)|
| 2:05:01| and had to make very difficult decisions about the future of their pregnancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| based on the toxicity of cancer treatment drugs, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| among so many other variables that come with that diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| I personally do not believe in a carte blanche approach to abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| but along with the majority of people I've had conversations with, agree there should be exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| I also feel the conversation needs to be expanded to focus on other options for unplanned pregnancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7524)|
| 2:05:30| such as making adoption easier in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| In addition, I do struggle with the current law that jeopardizes a physician's career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| those charged with saving lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| and can cause them to rely on the burden of proof if they perform an abortion to save the life of a mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| This certainly represents government overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| All that said, we have boundaries as city council members in our ability to be impactful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7554)|
| 2:06:01| and our change is to uphold ordinances, oversee the fiscal well-being of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| and problem-solve issues that are within our purview as a governing body, and this is not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7566)|
| 2:06:12| It is clear a lot of time and energy has been expended by all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| as well as the many people who stand on both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| when in fact this resolution will neither undo nor change the current state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| This is the sixth resolution this body has voted whether or not to submit to the Tennessee General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| and subsequent resolutions will not be taken seriously and ultimately become diluted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| resulting in lost credibility and influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| Those convicted on this or any other issue that are legislated at other levels of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| I encourage you to spend that time and energy reaching out to those state or federal electeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| who are the decision makers and actually are capable of being game changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| But in the meantime, my focus is to be here as a representative who can work with constituents on local issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7617)|
| 2:07:05| that I can actually affect, help fix, mitigate, and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you, Mayor. I plan on supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| I think as it relates to the state law that went into effect, I agree with the sentiments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| the words of the resolution, and the passion behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| I think the current law in the state is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| With that said, I do think there are appropriate times for this body to voice concerns to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7653)|
| 2:07:40| I also fear, I think it's healthy to say out loud, I fear retribution sometimes from state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7660)|
| 2:07:48| These types of resolutions potentially detriment our city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| We don't want state legislatures here telling us how to run our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| We don't want county commissioners here telling us certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| We don't need to invite any overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| With that said, I think this is an extremely important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| I think it's unique for a thousand reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| I'll be supporting this because I think it's that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| I see a couple of my wife's physicians in the crowd tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| Doctors, I did deliver a couple of Smiths into the world, so I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| When I think about that moment and how chaotic it was for my wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| I can imagine potential mothers being in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| It hasn't changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| I've always supported the elements of this resolution, but I think that brings it clear to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| that moment at which these decisions are made and how precious that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| and how unique it is to have power over your own decisions and your own body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| For that, I'll definitely be supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| The third part of this that I want to say is, for those of you that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| that spoke or emailed, and you feel passionate about this, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| You deserve to be heard and you're valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| But I want to challenge you to spend as much hours as we have over the past two weeks on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| advocating to your state legislators, some of which are in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| I spent a Saturday canvassing for one that I believed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| So I encourage you to use the same amount of energy that we have tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| advocating to the people who have the authority over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| So while I appreciate the substance of this and agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| sometimes it's our job to tell you a little bit behind the curtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| about what influence this has at the legislature and what to expect in return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| whether it just goes in the waste bin or whether it's taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| So I think it's really important for everybody that cares deeply about this to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| and to match the level of passion that you have here with the folks who can actually make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| So sometimes, I'm not suggesting it for this resolution, but for some resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| I think you mentioned six, we give ourselves a pat on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| and I think that's not necessarily what makes actual change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| So don't stop short at making a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| I think you need to put every bit of energy into making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| And so that's what I would encourage anybody here tonight to do as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| I don't plan to support resolutions in the future that we don't have authority over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| It's something that I've kind of come to over the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| There are tradeoffs, but this one is too important not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| and so I'll be supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| Council Member Puget and then Council Member Simms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| I will go on record again like I do every time we have a resolution that is requesting a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7847)|
| 2:10:56| that makes decisions for the same people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| So I have difficulty making resolutions to Congress, to the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7865)|
| 2:11:12| to anybody that anybody sitting in this room is already represented in that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7872)|
| 2:11:18| I echo what Councilman Smith said about taking the advocacy to the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7878)|
| 2:11:25| where the decisions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| However, where we stand now is we have a resolution before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| and it puts every city council member in a position to either vote to approve, abstain, or vote against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7894)|
| 2:11:43| I put my name on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| I have never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| But the concern I have in speaking to women of all political stripes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| who are concerned that there are no exceptions and that their doctor can be prosecuted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7918)|
| 2:12:07| is why I put my name on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| I don't necessarily agree with every other line in the resolution, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| We have to start agreeing where we agree and quit picking fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| We have to work together, and where we see common ground, like we did on the trees and the art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| we have to declare victory and continue to work for greater change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| This is a bold step for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| I will be getting vilified on both sides for not going far enough in one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| but I had a high-risk pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| My sorority sister was my OB-GYN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| I trusted her implicitly, and I shudder at the thought that she would have hesitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7972)|
| 2:13:00| to give me her best medical advice because she might be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| I have friends who are OB-GYNs that I called, that I talked to about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| who shared that same concern with me, and in a field where it is the highest malpractice insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=7991)|
| 2:13:21| the most stressful field, and people are leaving it already, that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8001)|
| 2:13:30| I said more than I wanted to say because you're supposed to keep it short and sweet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| but again, I don't like these kind of resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| Our vote tonight will do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| It will actually inflame some people at the state who might have reacted better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| had this come directly from you, the citizens, to them than through another elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8029)|
| 2:13:58| They don't always listen to other elected bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| They'd rather hear it from the people who actually vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| This has been a pretty incredible night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| Thank you, everyone, for showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Thank you to all my colleagues, everyone that has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| There have been some really loving, empathetic, smart words spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| I think the conclusion that I come to is this law is a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| It does not do what it was intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| It puts people in danger, and we've established that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| But I want to speak to the part about that we need to respect our proper boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| in being on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| I don't feel my boundaries are being respected, so I'm going to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| I'm speaking up for all of our constituents that are scared, worried, angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8096)|
| 2:15:09| I don't mean to get hyperbolic, but you guys know I work in the field of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8109)|
| 2:15:16| To say that we're going to have retaliation if we speak up, it's like saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8116)|
| 2:15:24| if I say anything, he'll hit me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8124)|
| 2:15:35| If you can tell, this is very emotional for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| No, but that's why I brought it up, was to bring a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| I worked hard, we all worked hard to get into this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| and I want to be able to bring up the voice of people who are hurting right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| and I just wanted them to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| I know that we cannot change what the state does, but what we're doing tonight is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8158)|
| 2:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| Council, seeing no further questions or discussion, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8179)|
| 2:16:25| Let's take a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| Okay, I'd like to call this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| We'll resume with Item 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| 11C is a resolution expressing appreciation to Visit Knoxville for the donation of $44,456| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| toward the purchase of new amenities at Fort Kitt Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| and authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary to accept said donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend the contract with Great Southern Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| for the Fort Kitt at World's Fair Park project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| increasing the contract amounts by $44,456 for a new contract total of $494,456.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8236)|
| 2:17:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| I just want to ask for an update on when we think the construction will finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| Chip Berry is here to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| It's a diamond of a city for kids and we all appreciate it, so we're excited to open the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| I told you not to ask me any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| That's the only curveball that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| So we are currently under construction right now for the new slope sidewalk that goes from World's Fair Park Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| up the hill to the parking lot and the new amenities that are going in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| That work has a little bit of delay because KUB has to move a high voltage line that's underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| That work should be done by the end of September, early October, and then the new playground structures will go in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8283)|
| 2:18:11| So hopefully by November we will have some new park amenities in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8291)|
| 2:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| And so the Fort Kidd will be open before the new year, hopefully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Oh, that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| That is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8305)|

| 2:18:42| So these items were actually in the design of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8322)|

| 2:19:00| and some benches in place because we didn't have those already planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| Or funded, excuse me, they weren't funded at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| And this item, the design has already come before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| so if the public is interested in seeing what the final design looks like, is that now available online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8350)|

| 2:26:51| First is Mr. John Zaida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Mr. Zaida, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8818)|
| 2:27:10| My name is John Zaida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| I live on 48th and Kerr Court in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| And I'm back here with commercial businesses being lit by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| It's a hard accusation, but it's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8844)|
| 2:27:30| The first building was my father's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| and we never remotely thought it was the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| The city, at the end, bought the store without telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| that they were from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| And the address with the document shows 747 College Street as the buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| The store was lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| We didn't know that the city, the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| is capable of burning businesses in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| Now, how I know this is by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| Anybody over here, anybody in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8890)|
| 2:28:16| gets a chance to take a look at the Bylow fire, the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| and the police report, you'll know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| you'll come to the conclusion I have come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| No one burned it but the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| The city blamed it on a black young man by the name of India McDowell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| India McDowell was not there, and that's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| Now, that's two stories, my father's and Bylow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| We lived in South Knoxville behind Parkway Motel, less than two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8927)|
| 2:28:55| We lived there so long, I know it's two miles to the traffic light over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| The day, the week that this hotel caught fire, I was passing by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| and I pulled in, I took pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| I didn't expect while I was taking pictures left and right around the building what I'd run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8950)|
| 2:29:17| What I had run into is gas valves in an empty building, just like Bylow was not empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8957)|
| 2:29:29| It was shut down for six months under the nuisance law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| The owner was supposed to go January the 18th to court, but it was burned December the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8974)|
| 2:29:41| Anyway, that store was unoccupied, even though it was full of groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| This hotel was unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| Someone went in there and put gas valves, and I know these are gas valves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| Nobody would put security cameras under gutters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| There's pictures of the fire department putting out fires where the gas valves are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9002)|
| 2:30:10| Nobody wants to listen to these three buildings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9010)|
| 2:30:17| The fourth, the majority of the people that would have cared, have already left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| The abortion clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| The abortion clinic was lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| And if the other three buildings, my father's in 1993, and believe me, we never thought the city did it, never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9033)|
| 2:30:43| But Bylow showed me something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| Parkway Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| If you take a look at these gas valves, I've taken pictures of it, and I've got the proof for it to back it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9050)|
| 2:30:58| And I'm sure that the city of Knoxville knows that I'm telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| Parkway, the abortion clinic was lit by this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| Again, crazy accusation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| I understand it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| The fire department, they came to my father's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| I had a car on fire, and I was grateful to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| And my father had a heart attack, and they came and rescued him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| They helped him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| It's not an easy accusation to come over here and say that the fire department's burning businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| It's not an easy accusation, but it's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| The abortion clinic, the picture with WVLT, I didn't go to the abortion clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9097)|
| 2:31:46| I didn't know it was lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| But I happened to go to a business across the street, but one way or the other, I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| And I seen WVLT, and it shows gas valves in that building inside the attic rafters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9115)|
| 2:32:03| The city's burning businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| We didn't know that the fire department, the truck when it rolls down the street, puts out fires, and it lights fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9127)|
| 2:32:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9135)|

| 2:32:57| I'm currently staying at 2314 Cordon Road because my home on Skyline Drive was set on fire by KUB in three separate attempts in one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9177)|
| 2:33:09| after I tried to start a conversation about allowing blacks to join our Masonic Lodge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9189)|
| 2:33:15| and after I berated the police department because they allowed a boy to lay on the road for three hours bleeding out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9195)|
| 2:33:22| before he died with no police response after I reported gunshots to 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| But that's not why I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| I'm here to talk about a little boy who watched his drunk father beat his little sister half to death with a belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9210)|
| 2:33:37| because she had made scratches on a dining room table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| Later, the same boy got permanent scars on his face from a rock fight with high school boys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9220)|
| 2:33:48| when he was only in the second grade after one of them molested his sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| The high schooler was the son of a Knoxville police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| In the eighth grade, the same boy would be bent over a desk and beaten 21 licks with a large board paddle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9235)|
| 2:34:02| for talking in class as girls screamed running from the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| The boy was only trying to help a classmate with an English grammar problem who had already flunked two grades in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| He was just a frustrated teacher in a new school and the boy forgave the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9254)|
| 2:34:21| In his sophomore year, the boy was beaten, kicked, and stomped by his high school coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| because he wouldn't play on high school athletic teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| The boy was working three jobs after school because his father had been fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| No time for sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| One of these jobs was with his teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| Teachers tried to get him to prosecute the coach, but he forgave him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| The coach was just frustrated in a new school with poor performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| The coach was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| After high school, he joined the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| After running an obstacle course, he was recruited to join the commandos because of his athletic ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9294)|
| 2:35:01| but he wanted schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| He was sent to a nuclear school where he was in line to become only the second honor student in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9303)|
| 2:35:10| of the school while competing against college men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| At midterm break, he and a lifer were asked to skip their leave time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9313)|
| 2:35:19| and move into the next class because so many people had flunked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| At his permanent duty station, after a rash of motorcycle accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| he started what would become the Motorcycle Safety Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| and developed a new cure for an orthopedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| Later, he was sent to solve a problem in a nuclear facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| where several other maintenance crews had failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| He discovered a problem similar to the two recent Boeing aircraft accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| where plane crashes were caused from a control system they could not override and shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9343)|
| 2:35:50| After correcting the problem, he wrote the system as being an over-designed problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| and was driven out of the military in a cover-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| After a trip to government overseers, the National Security Agency was sent to his home to shut him up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| but he was already on the road with AT&T Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| at the recommendation of one of his high school teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| where he worked seven days a week, 14 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| developing a new communication system across America during the Cold War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| He later resigned from AT&T in Wisconsin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| because of a corrupt supervising engineer in a northern area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| that caused the death of a contract worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| Later, one of his unfunded research projects outperformed work being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9388)|
| 2:36:33| at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and University of Tennessee Engineering Departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| causing an $800 million project to be canceled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| for which he was blacklisted in the scientific community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| but three professors at UT asked him to work on their grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| which the university could not prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| He bought a small home in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| and immediately noticed his elderly neighbor needed help with her yard and home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| but neighbors attacked him for helping her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| City codes enforcement threatened him that if he didn't stop helping her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| they were going to condemn his home, which they later did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| but he took pictures of the U.S. attorney who got it reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| But the insurance company refused to renew his policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| stating someone was going to burn him out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| which KUB later did in three separate attempts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| but no attorney would help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| In closing, last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| gangs that he used to protect the neighborhood children from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| when police refused to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| vandalized his home again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| doing an additional $30,000 worth of damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| then went next door and stole his research and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| and set his camper on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| This could have been prevented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| if the city had only allowed him to park his motorhome on the property and live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| But what do you expect from a city governed by bullies and corruption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| I appreciate and I apologize for having to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| Council members, that concludes public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| and without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220906?start=9482)|
