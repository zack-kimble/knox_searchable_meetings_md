| 0:02:28| Motion passes 14, yes, 5, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:54| Yeah, this was just a first reading. I think everyone understands and what it means is that we'll really have the opportunity to continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| It may be worthwhile to send a letter to the school board chairman, she left before I could catch her and was recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| to ask them to come back and let them study this for a month and then come back to speak to us again so maybe we'll have a better indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| as to what impact this will have and what the school board's recommendations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| Well, they've been advised and that's why she was here to begin with and that's why she was invited by both committees to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| and I'm sure she'll report back so I'm confident of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| I think she needs to be sent a letter. Can the law department send her a letter to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| I just made a call last time at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| 9-11-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| On page 14, consideration of a resolution of the commission of North County, Tennessee to urge the General Assembly to oppose Senate Bill 2938,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| House Bill 3590.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| 9-1 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And a governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| 7-0 to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| You have something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Mr. Chairman, could I have a second point of personal privilege?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Could we delay action that's on the floor before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Is Dr. Briggs wanting to address the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| No, Indy, all I wanted to do was, I was trying to catch you before you left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| And it really deals with, if you could, over the next month, have the school board look at this a little bit more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| This was a first reading and it won't become an ordinance until the second reading, as I'm sure you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| And then you can come back with some of the specifics because I think this impacts the school board, of course, more than everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| In the meantime, I can't remember how many split precincts we had, but I was thinking it was either four or six and it wasn't any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| It seemed like Greg McKay said it affected eight out of the nine school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| I thought that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| I believe, I think Mr. McKay just said there were maybe seven total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| Seven total precincts affecting eight of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| So it's not a big step, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| I'm just trying to, where we can lessen some confusion, to take at least a small step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| And I think also what Commissioner Wright said about when we lost one of our options on a recall because of the split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| And also just as a point, a lot of times we'll pass things on a first reading just to continue the discussion and to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| Because I know at least how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| It's going to have a lot to do with how the school board looks at this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| So that's all I wanted to do is let that be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| I didn't mean to rush out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| I just wanted to talk to Mr. McKay before he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| But I will look into what that impact would be and report back to you guys before your second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| I think also with the recommendation from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| I do have to say that we addressed this at the end of a three-hour budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| So we didn't go into great depth on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And we were pretty tired, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| That's what I had the impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Ms. Kincannon, you may want to hang around for the current item we're talking about, which deals, I believe, with some special school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| I would love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| I'm supposed to be doing something with some new teachers at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| So is there a question about the special school districts that you wanted to ask me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| I don't think so, but I don't think we need her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I'll say a few as long as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| If you have a statement you'd like to go ahead and make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| This is the pending legislation in Nashville about special school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| Well, our board, I believe, supports the TSBA, the Tennessee School Board Association position, which is in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| I think we, our board and our commission, we have a good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| And this legislation was proposed in part by school boards that do not have as good a relationship with their funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:35| In some cases, their funding body hasn't done the maintenance of effort, which is required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| So stemming from that frustration, they say, well, let's just have our own, let's fund ourselves and have the authority to set tax rates and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:50| I'm not sure if this legislation would enable, it would enable an entity to come back to a school board and say, does this community want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=470)|
| 0:08:00| It doesn't say a school board could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| It just is enabling legislation, similar to a lot of things the legislature says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| So for that reason, we're in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Thank you, Ms. Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| In the process, when you were leaving with Greg, I'm making the assumption that, as Dr. Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| that you all are going to analyze the issue we're talking about, the split precinct issue, not special school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| That you're going to do that, given us the board's perspective, and I'm making the assumption that Greg's going to do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| I mean, we didn't make that appeal to him before he left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| but we're assuming that there's some kind of analysis on their part as well to help us before the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| I'll get with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| I'll have the law department get with them, because that's not what we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| So I'll get with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| There also has to be a financial feasibility study done, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| The motion on the floor is to oppose the General Assembly, or to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| Oppose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I oppose them a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| I urge the General Assembly to oppose those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| Go ahead, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Having spoken to my state legislative representative, Mr. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:35| the issue about who has the authority to raise taxes resides only in two places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:46| either with individual county commissions or with the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| By state constitution, the school boards cannot have a tax base or raise their own taxes or raise their own funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=592)|
| 0:10:03| I think the intention was, as pointed out from the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| that some counties may not have a good working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| and would have the avenue of going to the state legislature for a private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| which would then set a tax rate in individual counties, which would be associated only with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| I don't believe that would apply to us in Knox County and that we are under charter form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| But now, Mr. Law Director, having heard me wander around on this subject, would you opine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:42| Well, sir, the way the bill is currently drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| it ostensibly would allow a school director to convert to a special school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| which does have some taxing powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| I only say that according to what is understood at the state legislature level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| there are only two bodies that can assess taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| and that is setting county commissions and the setting state legislature by state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:17| What can happen is the special school districts can apply for a private act to be passed by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| which would then in effect set their tax rate, which would be dedicated to school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| And there again, I ask the question, would that even apply to us since we are under charter format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| The bill was brought before the other charter government county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| and so yeah, it would apply to us if it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| It could apply to us if it passed because it was brought with the intention of the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| if I'm not mistaken, Shelby is the other charter, and it was brought for their benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| and so it could affect a chartered county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Commissioner Wright, if I could respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| I'm sure Representative Brooks is probably the most well-versed person on this, but you are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| This would not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| My understanding is that we have some special school board districts already in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| and they don't have independent taxing authority, just as you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| but they do have the ability to say, well, this is what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| and let's go to our delegation and have them put a bill forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| and then the state legislature, only the state legislature can approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| But my understanding is that they usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| I don't know if they amend it or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:47| As a co-sponsor of what's before us, I oppose the special school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| if there were any established in Knox County, having the ability to raise their own tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| It's my understanding that it would apply to Knox County, even though we honor a charter form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| The reason that I brought this forward is that if we want to have the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| have the taxing authority, then I'm all in favor of having that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| But the way we would do it is we would bring forth a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| we would have public hearings, we'd have a second reading as a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| then it would go before the folks for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| And during that time, the school board, county commission, citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| everybody would have a chance to go into the community and let their thoughts be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| But it would be by a vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| It would be transparent, it would be open, everybody would know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| the media would be all over it, and the people would vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| and it would become a part of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| That's the way I think it ought to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Not in Nashville, behind some closed door, which we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| they don't have to have their meetings in public, they don't have to be transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| like we do, because they're not under the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| And so you may remember that a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| the state comptroller, Mr. Morgan, advocated a statewide property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| What bothers me is if you give the legislature this authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| to start setting property taxes in any county in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| what's to prevent them then from passing another bill that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| by the way, we may take a fourth of a cent and bring it into the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| because they're having their own financial difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| There's nothing to prevent them from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| And so my purpose here is, if we want to have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| let's have the discussion, but let's do it our way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| which is public involvement, public scrutiny, vote of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| not by folks from O'Brien and Wheatley County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| who maybe are having some problems and let them make our decision for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| This decision needs to be made by the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| not by citizens in Lake County or Wheatley County or O'Brien County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| That's why I brought it forward, that's why I'm asking you to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| and let's send a message to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Chairman Strickland, can I just say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I just want to say that this was not a legislation that was pushed for by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Our school board did not push for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| and we feel like we have a very good relationship with you, our funding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| So I just want to reiterate that, that this was not something that we pushed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| or we don't mean to imply that you don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| That's why I said we do have a very good relationship and we do work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| That's why I said we want to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I'm all for having the discussion, but I think that we need to do it the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and that is take it before the community and let the community decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| rather than some of these folks in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Motion on the floor is to oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Tell me to approve the resolution to oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Approve to oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| 903 on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| I think you persuaded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Be open to persuasion later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| I was going to say, we're agreeing an awful lot today, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Be open to persuasion later, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Noss County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| empowering the Noss County Law Director's Office to exercise on the county commission's behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| section 15 of the amendment and restated lease agreement between Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| and Hillcrest Healthcare dated March 24, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| by putting Hillcrest Healthcare on notice for material breach of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| for cause in accordance with requirements of said section of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Item H10 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| 702 approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| You have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Who took it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Who took it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I took it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I think I would like to make a substitute motion to defer a decision on this for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:25| You all were supplied with a notebook, and Commissioner Harmon responded on the forum about the notebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:36| and some of the data there, and I respect his opinion about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| but when I look at it, when I examine the information that I've been given, which is lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:52| and then combine it with the fact that the recertification process for Medicare can begin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1072)|
| 0:18:02| and if we do not delay, if we delay, if we took a vote today, they possibly could be recertified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| and then we have already terminated their contract, which would be a tremendous lose-lose situation, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| So I'm going to ask for a deferral of, and I think I need to refer to Mr. Mason on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:28| in terms of how many, you sent us a letter that had, you're requesting how many days before we act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:37| The lease provides for a 90-day notice of material breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| If the alleged material breach is not cured within that 90-day period under the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| the county can then give a 30-day notice of termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| We think that the recertification survey is very likely to happen in the month of June or by the middle of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:09| and therefore we're asking the commission to delay any action until its July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| Until its July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Okay, so that will be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| I just wanted to get Mr. Mason's take on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| I got your letter and got, of course, the binder a week or so ago and talked to Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| and I've got a lot of reservations about whether to move forward on terminating this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| or put you on notice officially if there's a chance that your entity or Hillcrest can turn the situation around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| I'm torn between how traumatic it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| We've all got the e-mails and the letters and a few phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| mostly e-mails and letters about people with relatives being moved north and south and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| I want to avoid that at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| I don't know if this is avoiding it necessarily, but how traumatic that is for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| I've lived in my house 30 years and I'm in okay shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| I don't know if I was an invalid or elderly and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| I don't like moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| I know how these people feel and I certainly sympathize with what's going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| and I'm leaning towards what Commissioner Norman said and what you're requesting in your letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| If you have anything to add, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| I guess my colleagues will question you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I think that part of what I'd like to do, if the Commission will allow me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| is just to take a minute to emphasize that Hillcrest is a public benefit corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| It has a single charitable purpose to provide residential nursing home care for Knox County seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| Hillcrest's board is made up of volunteers who serve without compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| Several of the members of the board are here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| and I think in your consideration of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| it's important that you know who's on the board and who's been participating in making our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:36| So let me introduce those who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Curtis Curley, a retired financial insurance and risk management executive for the UT Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:48| Dr. Bill Law, a retired physician who practiced in Knoxville his career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| Joe DePue is a retired hospital administrator with HCA during his career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:06| Lee Bell, Vice President, Home Federal Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| Mark Walker, Vice President of Finance for the Knoxville Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| There were a couple of board members who, due to various circumstances, couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| I'd like to call their names out anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Mary Embler is the CFO of Shoney's of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Rosa Thomas is a nurse with the UT Health Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| And Senator Ben Atchley, of course the former Tennessee State Senator from this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| are all members of the board and all, although three of them aren't here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| very actively participate in our work and in the decisions and the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| and the requests we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Last, Jim Murphy, who I think you've all met last month, is Hillcrest's president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| and he's also on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Jim's career included work at both Baptist Hospital and Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| As you can see, the board is broadly representative with both hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| healthcare-oriented people as well as people who are used to and have participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| for long periods of time in making serious financial decisions for healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| and other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| We don't think that Hillcrest has breached the lease and don't think that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:54| a basis for the county to give us a notice of 90-day of material breach to cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1434)|
| 0:24:03| That's not to say that what happened with Hillcrest's loss of its Medicare-Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:13| provider contract is not a significant issue or that it's not extremely unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| It has had serious detrimental consequences for Hillcrest West residents and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Nevertheless, a nursing home's participation in the Medicare-Medicaid program is voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| and nothing that Hillcrest has done and nothing about Hillcrest's loss of that provider contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| constitutes a failure to comply with applicable laws affecting the leased premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| Therefore, our conclusion is that the contract, in fact, hasn't been breached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| As Commissioner Norman pointed out, though, we really don't want to be in a legal argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| or in some formal proceeding with the county about Hillcrest West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| There are more important issues to focus on to our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| Just very briefly, here's what we think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| First of all, the federal regulator's decision, of course, earlier this year required that Medicare-Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| residents be relocated from West by March 8th, and we completed that under the supervision of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:41| All Medicare-Medicaid residents have been relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| We have a four-step plan that we want to implement going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| The first step is to apply for Medicaid recertification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Under the Medicaid rules, that's a state matter and Hillcrest West may reapply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| and we're ready within days to submit that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Step two of our four-step process would be to anticipate and prepare for the recertification survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| After we reapply in step one, and 90 days have gone by since the termination of the West Medicaid provider contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:33| the state will schedule an unannounced survey at a time that's fixed in the state's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| That's why I can't tell you exactly what kind of an extension we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| Although we can't set ourselves and we won't know the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| we can reasonably expect that that survey will occur sometime between the 1st of June and the middle of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1612)|
| 0:27:02| We've worked hard, as I told you last month, and we've continued to work hard at West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| and I'm confident that West will be subject to that survey and that we'll pass it in the next three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:18| Step three of the plan would be to begin admitting Medicaid residents to West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| Once we pass the recertification survey, West can begin admitting Medicaid residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:34| and we begin by contacting our former residents who were displaced during the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:43| Step four, the Medicare portion of our population is a federal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| and we begin the Medicare process following the Medicaid application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| That's the way it's laid out in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| We think a reasonable goal, a reasonable anticipation would be that by early next year, early 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:10| we could have completed that process and be able to readmit Medicare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| I want to emphasize that we're paying the state bed tax for all licensed beds at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:28| Hillcrest is not in danger of losing the certificates of need for the West beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| so long as we continue to pay that bed tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| But we have to be realistic about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Our plan is dependent on passing the state survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| If West does not successfully complete the survey, as I said in my letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| we will cooperate with the county in transferring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| in accordance with the applicable state regulations and unsatisfactory mutual business terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:04| West's beds and licenses to whatever successor entity you pick to follow on at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:15| Mr. Chairman Kay Flambers, a citizen who has direct information about West, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:27| And when I'm done and have answered any questions the commission has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| she'd also like to have a chance to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| I'm going to get these lights first and let someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| Anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| I'd like to speak to Mr. Mason, if I could, if I'm next in line, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| I don't know where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| Mr. Mason, I have a great deal of respect for you and the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And I think the intent of, you know, you say you haven't breached the contract material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| I think the intent of the contract legislatively is that Hillcrest has provided buildings to take care of Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:21| indigent or those who have, you're to maintain a good population of Medicare and Medicaid patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| I think that's the intent of this body when we granted that contract renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| And I want you to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| I do and I support Commissioner Harmon or Norman rather in this delay to try to get some, to keep us out of court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:47| to keep both of us out of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| But I want to see progress to the point where one star is not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| I want to see two star and three star facilities for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| You're there for rent free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And other facilities are getting two stars and paying the rent and paying the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| And the intent of this commission, I hope I'm expressing this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| the intent for Hillcrest and Knox County to continue the relationship was so you could provide that population with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| comfortable facilities, great care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| And with the suspension of your Medicare and Medicaid at West, you can't continue that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| And I think that to say there's no breach, there is a breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Because we're giving you a subsidized facility to provide for Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| And I hope that, I want you to succeed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| And I'm for the 120 or whatever the July date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| But don't think that if you come up here with the same results that I'm going to vote for you again because I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| Knox County deserves better than one star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| We provide you with a great lease, a great facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And I would anticipate my intent to vote later if there's no progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| I can't vote to continue to deal with Hillcrest if they're not going to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| Commissioner Briggs, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| I wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I think that Commissioner Andrews really articulated well at least how I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| So I'm not going to go over again what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| You know, I think as we look at this, and I'm addressing this really to all the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| is that the primary concern is not who's managing Hillcrest, not the lease terms, this or that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| but are the patients being taken care of very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| The most disruptive thing in an elderly person's life that may have borderline mental functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| or may have Alzheimer's disease is a steady environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| And it's an environment that deals both with the physical environment and also the people around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| I've received many letters from family members that have their elderly parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| or elderly relatives at Hillcrest, and they're very, very complimentary about the staff that's at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| And I think you're very fortunate to have some very good people that work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| But the fact that Hillcrest West had to close to Medicaid patients and Medicare patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| and move them was extremely disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| And I think just as Commissioner Anders said so very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| is that we really provide that facility to Hillcrest at a very good rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| so those resources that you would be spending both to either buy a facility or pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| or pay rent on a facility are devoted to improving the patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| And just like Commissioner Chouse had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| is that I'm sort of torn about what to do as to whether we should give you the 90-day notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| because I do think that this was a material breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| But also I think, and I asked this to the law director at the finance committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| is if we did give 90-day notice and in that 90-day period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| the Tennessee Department of Health came back in and recertified the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| then there would no longer be a material breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| And so we may not have a very good case if it went to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| But I think that what we really have to do is to see that that facility passes the inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| that we're not having to move people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Because I tell you, my tolerance, if six months from now or a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| if it became decertified again and we're moving these elderly people out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| that would be something that I don't think that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| I think it's two strikes you're out in a case like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| And it's sort of borderline anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| But I think we just have to be absolutely certain not only that the facility is recertified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| but then also try to make it even better than what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| And it sounds as if, I've talked to several members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| and I've talked to you before too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| it sounds like you're really trying to turn a new leaf to get Hillcrest back to where it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| It ran into financial difficulties and other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| And I hope that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you, Dr. Briggs and Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| I don't have any disagreement with the goals, objectives, and purpose for our next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:38| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Unlike Commissioner Briggs, I don't have a fine line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| I think we've come to that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Last year when we voted for this, I took a lot of heat for my vote to keep you guys in over there at Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| because I had two objectives in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Number one, the patients, and number two, the employees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| When all this came up, I called last Monday, well, it came up before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| but anyway, I called last Monday and talked to your Lisa, your attorney over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| and she said that some of the corporate grace people, are any of those grace people here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Mr. Tolbert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| And Mr. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| So I had a conference call with them on Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I said, okay, I want two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I want a census report and I want a copy of the last state survey, which she said was done in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:53| so that I would have them to be able to discuss before the conference call on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| At 10 minutes to 2 on Wednesday, my fax machine starts, I get the census report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| So we start our conversation at 2 o'clock on a bad note, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| because I didn't have them at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| They started coming in at 20 after 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| This is a report done in January, and you guys have a copy of what was sent to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| which was not the complete report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Pages 3 through 9 are missing, plus anything after page whatever 19 that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| But some of the things that are listed on here, these things that are listed on this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| happened between September or October through December of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| Now, if Grace took this over in April of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| I mean, I've got great respect for the people that you have on the board here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| but somewhere this information is not filtering down line to the people who are doing the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| because in this report there are some serious, serious accusations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| and some have been substantiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| My wife has a doctorate in nursing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| As these came off of the fax machine, she's reading them over, and she specializes in elder care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| She's reading over through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| I can't believe this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| I can't believe this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| So why are these things still happening in October, November, and December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| when they should have been stopped six months before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| That's what concerns me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| And I had, on a personal note, I had my mother in South over there for almost a month in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:45| and we took her out of there because of the care, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| And I'm not ashamed to tell you that's the reason we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| The insolence that was shown to my family and my mother, I wouldn't put anybody through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| Now, I've had relatives in five different nursing homes around this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| from Maryville to Sevierville to Knoxville, north and west, or south and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| That was absolutely the worst experience I've had with a nursing home in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| Now, we keep saying we're going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Can it change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Can it be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| If not, let's find somebody who can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I hope all associated with Hillcrest and Grace get the idea that we're all very upset with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| It's just a matter of how and when we express that, that we have some modest disagreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| But Commissioner Brown is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Our patience is wearing very, very thin, and our willingness to accept assurances is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| I was particularly galled when you said that you don't think that Hillcrest has breached the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| As Commissioner Anders has said, it's obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Now, maybe you as an attorney have to say that on behalf of your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Here's something you didn't have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| that you think there are more important issues than what happened at Hillcrest West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| There is nothing more important than elderly people having to be relocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| because their facility lost its Medicare certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| And when I look at the binder you sent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| and I hope commissioners get a chance to read the posting I put on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| let me give you a simplified version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| When it comes to the star rating system, it's not a perfect system. No, it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| But nationwide and statewide, look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| If Grace were even performing at the nationwide or statewide level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| then 20% of its facilities would be in the one-star range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| But it has 35.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| It's 15 percentage points above the national average in worst-performing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| And at the top of the scale, it's 15 percentage points below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| I should tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| What else should we learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| That Grace's performance and Hillcrest's performance was so lackluster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services opted to terminate certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| when they had lesser options, such as giving more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| They didn't. Their performance was so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| And what does that special SSF thing we see, that special focus...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| Special focus facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| You know what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| What that means is it has more problems about twice than the average number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| It has more serious problems, including harm or injury experienced by residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And it has a serious and persistent pattern of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| This is the situation which we find ourselves after being very generously charging you a buck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| for the rental of these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| My patience is worn thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I don't know why Commissioner Norman is willing to wait to see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| I think because we can drop court cases or we can rescind notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| that we should proceed immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Because these things are so offensive to me that we need to express our disapproval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| by finding another and a better contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Briggs expressed my feelings, I think, fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| Commissioner Brown, Dr. Harmon have expressed even stronger feelings of displeasure, distrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:59| But I would like for us just a moment to drag ourselves back to the motion that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| I believe that Commission is faced with one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| and I believe that Hillcrest is faced with one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| We are faced with whether or not in the next 120 or 140 days that their contract be terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| Hillcrest is faced with whether or not within that same basic length of period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| that they are either recertified or say they're going to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| Since both those things run concurrently at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| they either get themselves certified and stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| or they're not certified and they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| We can do whatever we want, but really the ball's in their court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| And that's the motion that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Now, I've got to drag myself back to reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| That's the motion that's before us to delay for a certain period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| and I'm in favor of the delay and would like for us to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| It's almost 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I'm glad to hear some of the commissioners are talking like I was talking a year ago here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| I said I wasn't going to say a whole lot up here, but I asked for some information about North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| You told me that you brought it up from the one star,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| and I asked for the deficiencies and what you had improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| The only thing I have here is what Commissioner Brown gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| There's approximately nine pages missing in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| This is on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| In half these pages, there was no corrections done on them, if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| Now, here's another thing I want to get into, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| We're not moving these patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| These patients are done gone at west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| We didn't close this facility up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| The federal government put you out of business down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| I think that you should give the west facility up and concentrate on north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| You're going to be in the same shape on north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Now, I asked last year up here when Ms. Porter was down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| if north was under investigation like the west, and she said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| We'll come to find out they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| There are one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| I'm like Commissioner Harmon, and I've said it time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Our people deserve more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| When Brightville Nursing Home down here, and I'm just using them because I check in a 25-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| they pay taxes to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| They are for profit, and they're a four-star rating next to the highest you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| Now, that's not great, but another thing that disturbs me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| I'm hearing that west is wanting to be opened up for a pay facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| and I can't go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| What we'd like to do, Commissioner, is restore west to the same resident population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| that we had prior to being closed with Medicaid contract and a Medicare contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| and the same population that we agreed to serve in the lease we have with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| I don't know where the idea has come from that the goal of Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| is to fill west as a private pay facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| That's not what Hillcrest's mission is, and that's not what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I'm glad that's out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I can take your word on that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Because I know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| But, you know, I took a lot of heat here last year because I told everybody this was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| The Hillcrest employees were out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| You brought patients up here, and I believe most of them were for pay, and they booed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| And I turned around and told them, I said, I'm trying to protect your jobs and take care of these patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| This is what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Now, we've put it off, so I really feel like you've had a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Now, 90 days, you're saying you may get recertified in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| June to mid-July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| All right, 90 days would put us to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| The 30 days we've got to give you notice of that would put us into July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| But even if you get certified, how do we know these patients are going to get better care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| Show us what you're going to do with North in the next 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| Let's vote for this termination on West only if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Mr. Jarrett, can we terminate the West facility without terminating the other two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| Well, you have a lease for the underlying property, and I believe you can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Let's go ahead and push for the termination of West in 90 days and give them a chance to bring North up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| And if they can't get North up out of this one star, we need to terminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Now, you've got 90 days to get it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I don't know whether you can get it up or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| You've had over a year on this facility, and it got closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| But I think we should move forward, terminate the West facility, try to get someone to come in and open it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| and I don't care who it is, but someone to open it up and try to get it open for a nursing home as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| because we need this nursing home in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| But whoever gets it, whether you all maintain it or someone else gets it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| I want the patients that we've shipped out of Knox County have priority in the moving back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| I didn't vote for the extension of the contract last year either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| and although I didn't necessarily trust they would get their facilities in order, I was hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:08| But here we are today, and we can grant them more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| or we can go ahead and try to start this process and, in my opinion, go ahead and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| probably the least fortunate in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| those that need somewhere to live that can't afford somewhere to live, that need this type of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:38| I believe Dr. Briggs, and I could be wrong, the Medicaid part, is that the part that serves the short term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Or is it the long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| No, it's the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Someone can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| What happens is when a person exhausts their resources, they apply for Medicaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| and then there's a process, even if you have a pay patient and then their resources are exhausted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| it can take a couple of months to get them on Medicaid, so they'll still be covered then by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| Is it the Medicare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Medicare will pay really only, it will only pay completely for short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| Usually it's about 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| They'll pay all of it if the person is qualified for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| and then the per diem increases for the patient to pay up to 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| and I believe that Medicare is dropped after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| But Medicaid is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Is longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Is long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Medicare is very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| It only pays really, I think, all of it for 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Well, you know, it's just like here we are back where we were a year ago, except actually worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| We have patients that have been displaced, but at least they're somewhere hopefully safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| hopefully being taken care of, and to say, well, we're going to get this facility back up on its feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:55| and then move them back, so we're going to move them again, disrupt them again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| you know, this didn't happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| This took years to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| I think this body has been more than patient in allowing them to try to get their house in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| and it simply got worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| and I just think it's time that we take the step that I think we all think is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Let's get someone in here that I think and I believe can take care of these citizens long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:43| instead of possibly having to deal with this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| and I just, you know, sir, you said it may be next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| before that you finish going through all of the process of getting all of your certification back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I just find that disturbing, and you know, above all, I would, you know, if I were in your shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| I would be highly embarrassed that this has happened to something underneath my watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| so I'm in favor of moving forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| and I'm against the substitute motion of deferring this, and unfortunately we're just at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| Mr. Lutho, we don't need to put north and south through what the people of west have gone through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| We need to give them a chance to get those up, and if they can't, then like I say, we need to terminate that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| and right now I would just like to move forward with terminating west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Procedurally, Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| I make a point of order just to explain to Commissioner Pinkston that we may very well consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| but first we have to deal with Commissioner Norman's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| About a year ago we had this conversation, and about a year ago I stuck my neck way out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:12| We were ready to sell everything we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| I'm really disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I can't express to you how disappointed I am that this moment has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:29| I'm leaning toward Commissioner Norman's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| I respect Dr. Briggs' opinion, and I think Commissioner Andrews has expressed my opinion pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:44| but only because of the people that remain in these other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| I don't understand why in a year we can't do things that other companies can do in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:59| Commissioner Norman says that we can give you until mid-July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| If you can't turn it around by mid-July, I'm going to be in the camp with Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| Commissioner Lutho, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| I'm telling you, and I hate that to the bottom of my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| because I'm a very compassionate person when it comes to the people in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| and we all have different ways of expressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| I think tonight you need to find some management team that can turn this thing around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| and we need to have some resources put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| We don't have the overhead at Hillcrest that your competitors have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| I mean, I'm just dumbfounded why we're in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| There are skilled managers out there that can handle this kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| that have the real ability of turning things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| And I'm not going to pound you personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| I think being a volunteer and doing what you are doing is a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| It's admirable to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| And I think you're doing the best that you think and you're doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| and you're trying to make the right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| But this body right here is on the edge, beyond the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| And I would just say that I'm going to support this substitute motion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| and I hope that the rest of the commission would do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| And I hope that you can turn it around because if this substitute motion passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| and you get this second chance, it is the third strike for Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| and not just in one location, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| I mean, they're wanting to terminate one location here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| If this comes back to my door again, it will be the third strike for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| I was hoping to save patients last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| That didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| I was hoping to save jobs last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| A lot of jobs went down the tubes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| So I know people that have lost their jobs since we gave Hillcrest a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| and now I know that patients have been moved since we gave Hillcrest a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| And I'm going to be willing to vote one more time for Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| but only because you've been in this community so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| and that your board is such an esteemed body of citizens that I know in your heart you want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| Now, the professionals that you hired may be letting you down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| and I would recommend that you look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| And I would recommend that you find somebody that can lead this train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| And that's the best advice that I can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| And I'm not going to give you legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| but I don't know about taking that idea that we haven't had a breach into a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| I would probably think that the opinion would not fall in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| I'll leave that up to the wiser, we call them judges, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| But I'm going to support Mr. Norman's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| and I just wanted you to know where it was in my heart because the last time this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| at the moment, I felt all alone when I stepped out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| And I just want you to know where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| What do you do for another inspection, Mr. Brown would like to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| They're closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| We'll expect an inspection in June to mid-July at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:31| You can't request one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| In a case like this, you can't request a special state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| This is Trent Talbert, who's the Chief Operating Officer of Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Let me let him answer that technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| We need to state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| My name is Trent Talbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| I'm the Chief Operating Officer of Grace Healthcare, and I live in Chattanooga, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| Currently in Tennessee, we operate 12 nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| One problem with Mr. Harmon's statistics is they're not all named Grace Healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| and they're not all listed as buildings we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| We have 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| I'm sorry, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| We have 19 buildings in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Of those 19, 12 are at three stars to five stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| Seven are two stars and one star, which puts us above the national average for performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| Of those seven, six of them we've operated for less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| The five-star rating is basically a three-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Our history has been that we take on buildings that are troubled, and we improve those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| and we're very successful with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| As far as the requesting survey, we do request, but it's always going to be a—they can't give us notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| so they will just show up one day for that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| Commissioner Haven-Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| I guess my question would be to the gentleman there with Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Can you tell us a game plan, what you're proposing to do to get west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| And if we give you the 90 days, what's your game plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| I think like Mr. Mason said, the game plan is what we're already operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| We already have 25 residents in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| There's an ALF plus private pay residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| We're continuing to take very good care of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| Once we apply for Medicaid, which we're applying this week for that, the application's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| We're applying this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| They come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| They put us on the calendar after 90 days of that February 6th date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| which was the date they came in and started the DSERP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| The DSERP process started because of a survey back a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| that resulted in several immediate jeopardy tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| It's all based on a point system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| That one survey racked up a ton of points for Hillcrest West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| It was right prior to us taking over the management piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| At that point in time, the lady at CMS, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| the head of the office, already had Hillcrest West on her radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| and had made the decision that we're going to have to be perfect from there on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| So we have a multitude of currently in Tennessee, I have six regional nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| who are majority of them are licensed administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| I have three clinical VPs who are based out of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| During the last survey at West, I had six regional level and above nurses at West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| for two months prior to that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| What we told our people was the thing that will get us is a fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| If we have a fall, we could potentially get a G-tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| We had a resident who was on a low bed, rolled off the bed onto a mat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| and had done that several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| In the process, had injured himself during one of those falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| He was a discharged resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| It was a chart review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| In this chart, he had been discharged more than a month prior to the surveyors coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| They reviewed the chart and they noticed his falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| So we're kind of under the gun as far as history on this focus list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| and seriously challenged to basically be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Back in November, we received a G-tag for a wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| I've got a wound on my hand that's about the same size as that wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| A nurse pulled the Band-Aid off and pulled the scab, reopened the wound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| continued to treat the wound but didn't call the physician for any kind of updated orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| We received a G-tag for that wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| Back to our plan, we're diligently involved in the building right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| We continue to have our regional nurses in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| as well as all three of the Hillcrest buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| We will continue to operate that facility survey ready every day until the surveyors come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| I agree with just about everybody on the board that has spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| and said that of course we are very concerned and disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| My own personal experience is very different from Mr. Brown's, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| in terms of when I visited the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| When I visit West, and I do it random because it's within my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| I'm always very impressed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| I have some experience with the nursing homes from my mother's experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| There's a lot of things in this job that makes my head hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| but one thing that really makes my head hurt is looking at that rating system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| and to think about the algorithm and the formulas and the matrices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| that are used to design that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Now, I wonder about bureaucracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| and the size of government that it takes to manage that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| This information, you all sent us a letter about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| the questions that we have about the rating system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| I mean, that's documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| The American Healthcare Association note that you had in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| All these things make me step back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and I'm in alarm almost at what you have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| and that's not to mention the individual strange mitigating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| around that fall, around the wound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| all these special things that have to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| I continue to be impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Then I look at the board who's come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| many of the members of the board who's come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| and I've been completely impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| I've known Bill Mason for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| totally unrelated to anything in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| He's just an outstanding person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| He's just in every way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| And so it gets down to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| You see the board, you see Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| I mean, these are wonderful people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| completely dedicated people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| and it takes, so we get over here on this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| and we become hypocritical of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| that we're not even really, we're just remotely familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| And so that's the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| I'm not saying that you guys get a pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| hey, go on, pat you on the back, did a great job, see you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Of course, we're holding you to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| but given all of the things that you are dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| the cumulative effect of all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| it's certainly worth some more time, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| And then considering the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| what's best for the folks that are there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| What if we do terminate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| I just don't see it as being helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| And I think you're worthy of some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| So thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| I also echo the same that Commissioner Anders and Briggs and Armstrong have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| and Norman, because I want Hillcrest to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| My number one is that to make sure these patients are being taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| and their families and, of course, the employees that Hillcrest helps serve throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| I've grown up with Hillcrest North all my life, pretty much my back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| I remember when Hillcrest was up off of Maloneyville, my grandmother was up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| So I've known about Hillcrest my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| But I am disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| I really, really am disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| I really wanted to believe that Grace could come in here and turn things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| I'm very aware of the health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| I have a husband and daughter that are both doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| And I know how hard they work to make sure every T is crossed, every I is dotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| that every medication is documented, there are orders that they leave for the nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| and the nurses call all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| I mean, because the person that's at stake is that patient, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| that says, do you want this or this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| And somehow, some way, it does look like Hillcrest is missing out on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| where things aren't being documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| And I don't know what the answer is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| But these are people's lives that a little sore like that, rampant MRSA could start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:47| I mean, even though it seems so insignificant, with people that are there at Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| they're very, very sick people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| And a lot of times have nobody to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| So, you know, I'm going to have to echo what my other commissioners have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| because I am all about taking care of our elderly here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| But I would have to agree on what Commissioner Armstrong said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| If by mid-July or whatever it's not turned around, it wouldn't be just to relinquish one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| I think we would have to consider the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| because apparently the patients in all in Knox County are not getting the care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| But I want to say that I want to give you all another chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| and I want to make sure that you all are able to turn this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| And I don't know what changes need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| but all of these little things that's been brought to our attention may seem little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| but they're big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Little things can turn out to be the worst of things with like a little infection or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| So I just want to say to my people in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| I've not received one phone call or email telling me to give Hillcrest up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| It's all been to continue to support, keep them open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| So I will have to go along and support what Mr. Norman has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| and allowing you all to have some extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| Yes, I want everybody to know when they're talking about the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| the structure down there is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| When they're using the building, they're talking about the people in it and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| One other thing I want to say here now is we're talking about July, they may get recertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:43| That still doesn't say that our patients are going to get taken care of, that our citizens are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| They can go back down there and open up and it may still be a one-star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| What I'm saying is they should have taken the money that Knox County gave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| but not charged them any taxes, built in the buildings and furnished them and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| and hired more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| In Hillcrest, you should have better care than any other nursing home around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| because it's non-profit, you're not paying any taxes, you're not paying any rent, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| The county's furnished all those facilities for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| So really, they should be at least a three-star, in my opinion, or better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| because they ought to be able to hire more help with this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| If we don't do something on this, and everybody talks about they want them turned around by June or July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| how are they going to turn it around when they're not operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| That's just to get them recertified for Medicaid and Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| We won't know about whether the patients are being taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| probably three, four, five, six months down the road when they come in for another survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| I still think, and I'll stand by it, they need to put their resources towards north and get north up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| I asked for things, you, Mr. Trent, about the deficiencies at north and you told me it's a lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| and I said, well, show me the deficiencies and show me what you've corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| I don't have a thing here today on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| I asked you to bring that to get it all to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Don't have a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| This report we have here, there's about ten pages missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| The only thing I can think of is they're so bad you didn't want them in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| I don't know why they wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Half of the corrections are blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| There's been no corrections on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| We need to protect the people and the patients of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| I can't go along with the fairness because, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| that don't mean they've turned it around because they get recertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| Show us you can turn north around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Is that asking too much of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Is it asking too much of you to show us you can turn north around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| I think, like I told you, we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Well, I haven't seen any proof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| You've told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Well, the surveys are public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| So you could get online and look at surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I asked you about the deficiencies that north was rolled up on and you told me you'd correct it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| and I said, well, show me the deficiencies and show us what you have corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| We're still trying to address this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| I yield the floor to Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Bob Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Mr. Tolbert, I wanted you to know that the facilities figures I gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| were taken directly from Grace's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| I just didn't look for facilities with the word Grace in the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| So my figures are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Do you also run a facility in Michigan called Riverview Manor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Is that facility under SFF, special facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Meaning yet another facility managed by Grace that has in the SFF description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| a history of persistent poor quality of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| It had three deficiencies on its recent survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| Okay, but a persistent record in the opinion of the Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Mr. Boyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Just one thing, and this is an invite to Trent and to Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:21| Before you guys leave town, go over to South, go in the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| take a left down the first hallway, and sniff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| Will you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| The only reason I may not is South is currently under their annual survey this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| and I don't want the surveyors to feel like the corporate folks have to show up during a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| but I have been in the building several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| I just have one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| To be perfectly frank, I'm very close to voting to go ahead and terminate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| However, I think you can see that there is a lot of interest on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| that we see improvement in all these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| To be honest, the only way I'll even vote for Commissioner Norman's resolution is that I think we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:19| Hillcrest management, whether it's Grace or whomever is doing it at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| to come back down here on a quarterly basis, and we need to open this thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| This is where you're perfectly honest with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| This is where we see what deficiencies are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| I think Commissioner Pinkston and Commissioner Brown and Lutho and many others are making some very good points about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| I think it really, and also Commissioner Harmon, is that I think we need to come back down about every quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| and let us know what's going on, and if this resolution does pass to give you another 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:58| really all it is is just another 30 days to get this inspection passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| If you fail that, as far as I'm concerned, it's finished, just to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| We all agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| On the other hand, it's not acceptable to keep on doing the things where we're barely passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| I would like to add an amendment to this, if I would be permitted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| is to say we're going to have a report every quarter from Hillcrest about the problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| and what we'd hope to see is to start to see some progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| because even if you get your certification back, I think if we don't see progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| we've still have some very serious issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| and I think that's probably the sentiment of most people on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| You accept that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Is there any problem with that quarterly report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I've met with several commissioners and wanted to make you guys aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| and understand our concern about involving the county as far as any kind of operational oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:09| is that we don't want to give the public impression that the county is running these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| That would create a lot of additional liability for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| and we're trying to protect that through this process also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| Commissioner Norman, you want to make that a part of your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| Mr. Mason, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| We certainly don't mind reporting back quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Yeah, that will be fine as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Commissioner Saunders, are you okay with my being a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Just to be clear, is that an oral report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Will they show up or can they submit a written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I think they need to come down here where we can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| I think it's too easy to submit a written report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| and I think if there's some hard questions that Commissioner Pinkston wants to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| I would welcome them in many of the other comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| because I think the message we want to send is that we want to see progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| not just to get Hillcrest West recertified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| but we want to see progress in all the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| because we're really giving you a break on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| We need that information before the day of the meeting, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| so we can have time to digest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| I mean, it's going to be more work, but this is the price we have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| I'm not sure this is going to pass or not, but if it does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| I think this is the price you'll have to pay because you were very close to losing my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| but if we can see progress and we can get you down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| We don't want to run the nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| I don't want us to say you need to put more bed rails or mats on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| but simply we want to know that we're seeing progress in what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| On the surface, it seems like a good idea to hear back from Grace and from Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:13| but I'm going to have to agree with what the representative from Grace just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| We don't want to be in the business of running these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| and I think we start running a risk and a possible liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| If they're reporting to us what they're doing, how they're fixing possible problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| we start getting into maybe a liability issue, and that's one of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| My point is that we do not need to be in this business as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| We either let them run it or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| I just think that we're opening up another can of worms to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| It sounds good to hear these reports, but I see some possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| and I think you hit it on the head that you're trying to protect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| if we either allow them to do their job or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| Can I make one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| We're getting two responses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| We're having Mr. Mason that's saying, yeah, we'll report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| We're having the executive from Grace saying we don't think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| What's the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| I have no problem reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I mean, we report to the board monthly, daily, weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| I have no problem giving you guys a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| I'm just cautioning you guys that my concern would be that at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| someone is going to determine that the county has significant oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| and that could create a liability for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| So you're saying you think it's not a good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| I'm perfectly fine doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| I'm just cautioning you guys that you need to be concerned about that, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| I'll tell you, I'll withdraw my request for an amendment then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| Well, he's already made it a part of his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Unless he wants to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Unless he wants to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Do you want to withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| I think I would confer with these two fellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| What do you all think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| I mean, do you think that's helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| The report's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| I think it's, I guess, it depends on the responses, the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| Well, report to us in a way that doesn't jeopardize our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| And that we can get some general idea that progress is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I think that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Yeah, and I just, like I say, I just wanted to caution you guys as far as responses and expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| Well, we're not going to tell you what to do after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| You're just going to report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| We have a substitute motion on the floor with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Roll call, first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Could I get a clarification on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| The amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| I mean, on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| And the question is, because of that, of course, you know, we've been debating this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| Within the 120 day, is this simply extending the resolution that we have before us by 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| Or is this saying that after 30 days, we'll start thinking about the termination process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Yeah, if you'll just restate what the actual substitute motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| The motion was to allow Hillcrest West the July date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:55| And so whatever that is, whatever is required to prevent them, prevent us from starting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| from terminating the contract before their recertification comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| And so if that's 30 days, tell me, Mr. Mason, what is it that you need in terms of a time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:16| And of course, I can't give you a specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| So really, we're deferring this to July to give you that space that you may need for the state to do their work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:32| Other than our reporting back to the commission in June, we're asking that the commission take no action until its July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:42| Until the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| That's the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| What we're doing is we're giving them 120 days before we can start this 90 day deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| So that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| In other words, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| And then it's 30 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| 30 days, we're talking about extending it six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| We.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| If they don't pass re-inspection in the middle of July, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| They say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| They say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| Is that what you're saying, Mr. Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| If you all fail the next certification, you're going to work with commission to get off the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| At West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Pardon me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Go ahead, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| They're not talking about giving up their certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| They're talking about selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I've talked to them about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| If they lose their certification, they're still not going to give anything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Someone's going to have to buy it monetarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Is that not correct, Mr. Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| You know, what we're doing is giving them six months where if we terminated the West right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| started procedures toward it and let them try to get the others up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| we might get someone in there and open up that facility down at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| Don't forget their investment, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| What is their investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| What do you think their investment is over the years that they've been in that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| Don't forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| First district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| You all know I'm normally one just to out and out vote and always starts with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| but this one really, really troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| If this does not pass, we'll go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Can we make amendments to the original resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5091)|

| 1:32:44| the Metropolitan Planning Commission has collected over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| bushels of baskets of information on changes to the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| and I think it's more than we can undertake to understand this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| considering that we still have several other items to be considered on our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| So my motion is going to be that we defer for 30 days and have a workshop at Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Is there any questions to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| Brad said he wanted to chair that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| Do you all want to pick someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| I guess the chairman is going to pick a date within the next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:50| I did say 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| If we're unable to schedule a meeting in that 30-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| whenever the scheduled date would be would be when it's going to be scheduled to be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| If that happens to be more than our next meeting, well, at the next meeting I'll move to defer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| Let's just make it within the next 30 days and the chairman calls it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| That's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| And that's exactly what I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| But I'm sure you don't want me to lead it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| You want MPC, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I would prefer that you lead it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Set a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| He's not going to let me get by my five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| We'll pick it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:43| 905 on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| initiating procedures to remove Scott Moore from the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| in accordance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| I'm sorry, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| I wanted to make a request about the workshop, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Buy these boxes and they will be out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| I know that in the workshop that the city council had it went on for quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| and there was a very long presentation by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| and then another presentation by the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| and the community groups really did not get much of an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| So I would like to ask that they each be allowed no more than 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| to make their presentation and that they provide all the materials to us ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| so that we can study up on them before the workshop actually begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| If you're putting that in the form of motion, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| We'll just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| The chairman can use his discretionary powers to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| Finance on 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| I was on first, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| Let me start by saying how thankful I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| I am thankful for all the people who have stopped Becky and me just out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| and told me they were grateful that we were doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| that they thought it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| People I didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| I'm also thankful, by the way, to the very moving statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| invocation by Reverend Brabson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| where he told us and reminded us of the importance of being respectful and obeying laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| and of doing justice and being just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Those sort of guided me as I thought about what to say this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| You probably know these circumstances, but let me remind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| A civil court judge found that Scott Moore committed the functional equivalent of perjury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:17| giving false testimony in a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| And false witness is not only a moral stain, it's an ethical stain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| It's a legal violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| And while all of us are good people and forgiving people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| we recognize that things can be forgiven but not overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| And this is something that should not be overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| We all take oaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| When we assume this office, we took an oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| When you join a board or commission, you take an oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| When you take the witness stand, you take an oath to be truthful, to uphold the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| And thus, when Scott Moore was found to the satisfaction of a civil court judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| to have given false testimony, the functional equivalent of perjury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| it was a serious, serious violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| Persons have had fines, convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| Now granted, he's lost his position on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| but I would think a reasonable corollary to that is to also not be on another government body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| to not be on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| This is not, as someone suggested, a personal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| This is a personnel matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| This is who represents us on that body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| and I'm just suggesting it needs to be a different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| You see, we need to make a statement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| a statement that we find this behavior, this giving false witness, a serious violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| not something to be overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| And so if it only means three months that Scott Moore isn't on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| or three weeks, or three minutes, we make the right statement when we say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| You know, Amy has got the cookie boxes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| They talk about courage, confidence, and character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| I hope each of you has the courage, confidence, and character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| to cast the right vote in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And that right vote is to say we should start these procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| do the right thing, stand up for the principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| not as a matter of anything against the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| but the action is so repugnant that we need to make an important statement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| and let's make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| I'd just like to ask the law director as to what procedures or what grounds do we start this procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| and also who would bring the charges to the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| and how much time would that individual have to defend himself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| Sir, the creation of a Board of Zoning Appeals is a creature of state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| and that statute reads that the county legislative body may remove member for cause upon written charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| and after a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| So what would occur essentially is the chairman would send a letter to Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| outlining what the commission feels are the grounds for his removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| and then a public hearing will be set at a future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| The statute is silent as to when that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| but generally you would give a person at least 20 days to prepare a response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| because that would have to be a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:51| Okay, then who would bring the charges to him, the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| If you vote to move forward, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| I think the chairman would send a letter to Mr. Moore stating what the cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| Commissioner Harmon outlined cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| The problem is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| The statute says if the person can be removed for cause, it doesn't define cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| So that being the case, I did some legal research to see what our courts have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| and essentially it could be for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| What the courts have generally said is cause constitutes some action or cause on the part of the party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| sought to be removed that calls into question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| or adversely affects the ability and fitness of the appointee to perform the duty imposed on him or her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| brings discredit upon the appointed authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| or engages in wrongdoing or fails to adhere to established laws, rules, policies, or procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| And also courts have further said you can also develop for cause malfeasance or misfeasance in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| and the distinction between the two is malfeasance is essentially an illegal wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| that constitutes improper conduct while holding a public office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| and misfeasance is a legal act performed wrongfully that, although it may not be illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| is unethical, mistaken, improper, or inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| So this individual would have how much time to defend himself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| You get a letter and it would be 20 days later we would have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Well, the statute is silent, so if the commission feels that 20 days is sufficient time for him to prepare a defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| or you can set a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| You can send him a letter and say within the next 30 days or 20 days, whatever the commission desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| there will be a public hearing at which time he can appear and defend himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| I think my biggest concern about this is this gentleman has got, what, five more months to serve on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| We've had enough black eyes on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| Now, this is going to create another news media fiasco, and it's going to make us look even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| I mean, this guy is going off of the BZA board in September, and I'm glad I'm getting off commission in September, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6174)|
| 1:43:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| I mean, you know, I was, I did not vote for, I think it was Commissioner Burrell's resolution last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| because I said we have a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| That was my whole reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| We have a way to deal with BZA in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| Members that we feel have violated what we feel are the requirements for being on that particular board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:42| And ladies and gentlemen, listening to what the law director just read to us, it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| It really is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| Based on the statute that he just read, it's not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| He was put off of county commission for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| It's not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| It's not personal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| But this, you know, when we talk about gaining the respect, continuing that process and gaining the respect of our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:20| of our county, this will help to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| Leaving him on this board would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| It's saying wink, wink, nod, nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| We're going to let you write this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| For whatever reason, slap on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| This isn't a small thing that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| This caused him to have to leave this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| Is that grounds enough based on what our assistant law director just read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| Of course it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| And I don't mean to sound flip or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| If you vote against this, you didn't listen to what he said were the reasons for putting him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:10| You cannot say that what he was convicted of in a court of law doesn't rise to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6310)|
| 1:45:20| So if there's any doubt after hearing that law read to us a minute or two ago, it should have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| You know, if you all really had a problem with Mr. Moore serving on BZA, I wish you'd have brought this up a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:50| I mean, this could have been brought up several months ago instead of waiting until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| Now, I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| And I've got a variety of reasons that I'm going to vote against this because of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| Like Mr. Harmon said, Ivan Harmon, this does not do Knox County any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:12| When a business is thinking about locating to a place, and they Google Knox County, they see scandal after scandal after scandal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:20| And this isn't even a new scandal. It's an old scandal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| It's something that maybe if it needed to be dealt with that we should have dealt with a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| But to wait until today, when he only has a short time left, and essentially what we're talking about is sort of a tribunal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:39| He's going to get to Mount of Defense. He's going to get to hire a lawyer and bring a lawyer down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| And he's going to get to defend himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| And it's going to be a big, long, drawn-out circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| And I don't think that does Knox County any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Furthermore, if we do this, if this passes, I can't sit on a tribunal and sit in judgment of Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:04| I served with Mr. Moore. Now, Mr. Moore is not perfect. He's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| He's a human being like the rest of us, and he has his faults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| But Mr. Moore is a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| And I cannot sit in judgment of him on a court-martial-type tribunal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| And I think Dr. Briggs would back me up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| Being so close to him, I don't think I'm capable of sitting as a judge on a panel like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| So I would not sit in judgment. I would not sit on this panel if we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| I don't think I'm qualified to. I'm conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| And I think I'm being very honest when I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| But I think there's folks all around this table that are conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| Folks that are mutual friends, that are friends of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| Folks that maybe have had problems with him in the past and have a personal axe to grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| That creates a conflict of interest, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| I think that if folks start saying, I won't sit on this because I've got a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:10| And I think if we're all honest with ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| I mean, there's folks sitting here that still have litigation with Mr. Moore, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| I think if we're honest with ourselves, there's not going to be many of us left that can sit and hear this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:27| and rule on it based on its merits without their personal conflicts of interest getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| Now, if it were a year ago and there was a year left of his term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| then I might see the merit of moving forward to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| But let's just face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| BZA is going to meet in a few days if they haven't already met this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| It's going to go down to four meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| Then by the time we schedule a hearing, well, it's going to be down to three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| And then if he has a lawyer come down and postpone it for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| which I think he would be entitled to postpone it to prepare a defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| well, it's going to get down to two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| And is it worth giving Knox County another black eye over a couple of meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| And is it worth some of us sitting here, even though we're conflicted and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| oh, why, I don't have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Why, I can be fair when there are volumes and volumes and volumes and newspaper stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| that shows that most, a good bit of us can't be fair because a good bit of us are conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| They're either friends with the man, like I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| And I'll tell you, I played Santa Claus at his family's home for his children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| I can't sit in judgment of someone that I've been that close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| No more than I could sit in judgment with someone that I've fought with on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| I would be conflicted in the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| I'm not saying this doesn't have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| It may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| And if we had a year left, it might be just a painful thing that we would need to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:12| But considering that most of us are conflicted in one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| and the clock would run out and there would be very little time left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| I can't see any purpose to do this except,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| and again, I'm going to take Scott Moore out of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| I know it would put him and his family through some pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| But except give Knox County yet another black eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| We are in a recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| The recovery is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Lord, I hope it's soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| I pray every day that the recovery comes soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| But when the recovery does happen and people start Googling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| where do I want to place my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| I would like for there to be news stories about the positive things about Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| rather than taking a year-old, two-year-old, three-year-old scandal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| and recycling it just one more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| so somebody can score some political points and kick somebody just one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| So I hope that we vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| But if it does pass, I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| you've heard the last from me on this because I will not show up because I am clearly conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| And thank you for the extra time, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| I told you it was in your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| Fondus, Commissioner Fondus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Really a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| In this case, Mr. Moore was removed from this body for the reasons stated by the judge and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| But at the same time he was, and Mr. Law Director, you might want to answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| he was at that point serving on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| These weren't actions that occurred since he was removed from county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| And he did file an appeal, and that appeal ultimately affirmed the lower court ruling of ouster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:08| which I believe that came out just a couple of months ago, the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Commissioner Breeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| I believe there's another appeal being filed too, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| I believe there's another appeal being filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| That I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| I'm just, you know, the law director has no position whatsoever other than to give you an idea how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:37| The only appeal I was informed of was the one that just came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:45| Do I have the floor now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| I'm going to speak in support of the resolution by Commissioner Harmon for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| One is that ouster sets a very high bar as far as what you have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:04| and essentially he committed perjury, and that's what the court said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| and the appellate court, I think, upheld that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| He was on the BZA by virtue of the time of being on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| and those rules changed afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| So he is really on the BA by virtue of his position on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| The second question that I have has come out since then, and this is new information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| and it's not a year old, about, and I may be a little bit off of my dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| but he received essentially a $144,000 commission on the transaction of a $500,000 property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:44| And I realize that this is being looked at by the state realty board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| but I would have questions, and I'm perfectly willing to listen to this with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| I've heard him say that he owned options on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| and he paid the lady that owned the property money for this option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| and really all he was doing was exercising his options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| but yet the lady that owned the property said she never received any money from this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6845)|
| 1:54:12| I think that if this were a commission, which he's not allowed to receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| that sure seems like an awful high commission for a piece of property like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| And when someone sits on the BZA board where they're making zoning judgments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| I really want to know what's behind that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| And he may come in here and give a very good explanation, but I want to know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| To address some of the other concerns, I think for us to say, well, he's a friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:40| and therefore we're going to give him a pass on this gets back to the same old business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| that people have been complaining about in Knox County for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| Now, excuse me, I had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| I had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| Gets back to the same business that the Knox County government's been accused of for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| is that it's a good old boy network, and by golly, we're not going to judge our friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| and our friends aren't going to be held accountable for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| Secondly, does this bring another black eye to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| I think to do nothing brings a black eye to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| because it says we're going to tolerate what the courts and what other people would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| is intolerable behavior, and at least we need to bring him in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| and ask him questions about some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| The third thing, it's been said this is bad for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| I think what's good for business is for a company that would be looking to move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| or to relocate here is to know that we have a zero tolerance for questionable activity in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:52| and when we have someone that the courts has removed from office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| we're not going to wink and say it's fine for you to serve on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| When a company comes into town, they want a level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| and they expect the government to be fair and honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| and anything less than that is bad for government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| and I think if I were looking at a place to relocate a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| I'd like to know that the government is honest and that the people that do have the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| and the ability to do that will remove people that should be removed from office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| and not just wink and go ahead and say, well, it's only another six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| it's only another two years, and that we have a zero tolerance for unethical behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6988)|
| 1:56:35| And for that reason, I'm going to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| Not that I'm going to pass judgment, but I just have an awful lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| about some behavior and activities that really, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:54| brings a lot of questions to light about what's really going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| I need to look down and check my notes for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| but first let me say, Dr. Briggs, I appreciate your comments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| One of the first comments I've got written down is we should have done it months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:23| Maybe I need to pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| I do not have the attention of Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| He'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| He really would rather be listening, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| Let me back up and start again now since I got sidetracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| We should have done this months ago, but we have heard there was appeal pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| It'll be a circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Well, a circus sells lots of tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| It'll reflect poorly on Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| I believe that's the best one that Dr. Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| This will reflect positively on Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| $144,000 commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| I don't know anything about that except what I read in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| The case doesn't have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| That brings me to a couple of words that are in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| This resolution only is initiating procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| We're not having a trial tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| We're not bringing out all the pluses, all the minuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| All we're doing is having a simple statement of the fact that some people believe that this action should go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:46| and I'll not stand in the way of Dr. Harmon if he wants to take this cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:55| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| I just wanted to, as Commissioner Wright said, we should have done this months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| and it was not brought up months ago because there was an appeal process which has run its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| This is a black eye on Knox County, continues to be a black eye on Knox County until we do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:23| As Dr. Briggs said, not doing anything is a much worse reflection on our government than taking action at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:33| I think that, as Commissioner Lambert was saying, businesses Google Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:41| and read what's been in the paper about what's happened with former Commissioner Scott Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| and his trial and his removal from the commission and his questionable commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| and then they look at Knox County government and see he's still serving on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:05| That's not a county that I would feel comfortable taking my business to because it tells me right away that there's something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7205)|
| 2:00:13| So it may be a little later than we should have done it, but it's time to do it and we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:24| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Yeah, I'd hoped that I could handle this privately, but I'll handle it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| I just want to clarify, I did not say we should give Scott Moore a pass because he's a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| What I said was is that if this passes, that I cannot sit on a tribunal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| I believe that my comments were misrepresented by my colleague, a colleague that I have always spoken very highly of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:51| and perhaps I misunderstood what he said, but I want to give him an opportunity to apologize if that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7251)|
| 2:00:59| If he truly said that I thought we should sweep this under the rug because Mr. Moore is a friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| that I am deeply offended by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| That is not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| I said that if we have a hearing, that I can't sit on it for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| I said that we should not be hearing this because we waited too long, quite simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| and that this should have been heard months ago, and I spelled out all the reasons why it was not good to reopen an old wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:31| But Mr. Briggs, do you really believe that I said that we should sweep this under the rug because he's my friend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| No, no, Chairman, why don't we just let the tape speak for itself and move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:48| I'm asking Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| He's not going to answer, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7314)|
| 2:02:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Well, I am deeply offended, and I just can't believe he won't respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:11| Apparently he's not who I thought he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Is Joe still up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| Yeah, I see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| Wake him up there, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| I see nothing wrong with moving along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| I can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| I think we should follow the law director's directive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| After we get the letter up and send it to him, I think he should have 20 days to get his evidence up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| And since these other allegations have been brought forward, I think we need to at least give him two days to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| and defend himself on these things before we come to a conclusion on it because there's been other allegations brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| And I think after the letter, after we get the letter going, that he has 20 days to reply for the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7380)|
| 2:03:09| and then we come up here and we give him at least two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| Now, Joe, would it be the full commission that sits on this hearing or the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| It will be the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| The county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| And written charges have to be preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| Now, I can draft a letter for the chairman's review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| but the commission is going to have to articulate what they feel is the repugnant portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:42| so he can be put completely unnoticed because he has a right to due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| He shouldn't have to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| It's like a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| We get lawsuits tossed all the time because they're not properly pled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| We go to a judge and say, we have no idea what they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| This basically is insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| So you want to outline with specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| This is what we feel, rise of the level of cause, so he doesn't come here for a hearing and then is ambushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| He needs to have his due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| So whatever the commission feels as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| Well, I think you need this letter, I think you need to send all the commissioners here a copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| and we need to agree on that, too, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Well, of course, sir, we don't want to get into a sunshine issue where I'm polling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| I think that Commissioner Hammond has asserted quite clearly that the preponderance of the complaint is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7467)|
| 2:04:35| excuse me, Harmon, my apologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Commissioner Harmon quite clearly articulated that the fact that a court of competent jurisdiction ruled that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:48| Moore should be ousted and then a court of appeals affirmed that ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| that's the first clear issue for cause that I think could be in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| If there is another, then I should know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Because you don't amend it when he gets here before you in the podium and say, oh, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| there's some other things we find repugnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| Well, I think we need to go along with the 20 days that you talked about for him to reply and come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| and then give him two days to defend himself at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| That's the commission's, you know, commission, I just threw that figure out to give you an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| but, you know, I'll defer to the commission's wisdom there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| But so far we have the ouster slash perjury as outlined in the court's orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:33| Is there any other grounds that you want to put as a body politic if you go this way as grounds that he needs to defend himself against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:43| As the maker of the motion, I would like to keep it clean and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| And although Commissioner Briggs has raised an interesting concern, it's one that's kind of still up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| So I'd like to keep it clean and simple with just the ouster perjury expressed as meeting the standards of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| and you would write that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| That's my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| And give the appropriate time that Paul has indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| Are you finished, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Commissioner Armstrong here being an attorney, he told me we ought to make it 30 days for him to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| So I think I'll put that in the form of a motion, 30 days for him to respond after he receives the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| I accept that as a friendly amendment, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| I don't think we need to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| Again, I threw some figures out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| That's totally within the commission's discretion, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| The more time you give, obviously, the less time someone can assert that they weren't given their due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| Thirty days is an acceptable figure, 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| You don't want to go below 20 days is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| So you want to make that into your motion, 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| The criteria I outlined in my resolution, written up by the law director, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7614)|
| 2:07:05| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| I did, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| Commissioner, if this passes, I would like to ask that, with the law director's advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| that everybody go into it knowing what the procedure is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:28| Who's going to be speaking on behalf of the commission, or is it Dr. Harmon who brings the charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| I want to know what the structure of the hearing is going to be so that there's no questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:41| and no reason to delay unless there's absolutely necessary things that we can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| But I want to make sure that we know the structure, and I ask that Mr. Jarrett put that structure together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:54| in accordance with due process and with procedures normally seen in maybe a courtroom or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7674)|
| 2:08:02| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| I'll certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| I still had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| I know that Commissioner Harmon wants this to be a single-issue thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| but the fact that if what we read was true, you know, about this commission, that seems like a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:24| I mean, I don't know if it's true or not, but to me this would be something that he should respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| because I think if indeed, you know, I mean, if he wants to show us a check on a contract that he signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7710)|
| 2:08:36| with the lady, but if he just received this much money on an issue that was a zoning issue, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| then the Board of Zoning Appeals deals with these same issues every time they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:50| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| That's going to be in a federal court right now, and I don't think that we need to be discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Dr. Colonel, Commissioner Briggs, I'm open to suggestion that perhaps for those to be considered as separate issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| and each voted on separately so they don't become combined and create a problem for one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| I'm happy to approach it either way, keeping it as a clean resolution with just the perjury ouster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| or considering your thing as sort of a second charge that must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| Either way, the Board wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| The second issue I had is what Commissioner Pinkston said, that he would have 16 hours or two days to defend himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:26| I mean, that seems like a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| I mean, I don't know if that's excessive or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| I mean, he's already been convicted in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| I mean, he can give an explanation as to why he still wants to sit on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| but we don't need to retry the entire perjury trial about why it was perjury or not perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| I mean, it's been established that he committed perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| Well, now, he may not take that long, but I think we need to give him at least a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| He may not take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| And I believe Commissioner Harmon accepted that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Let's stay on topic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Right now, Commissioner Briggs, you've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| I mean, do we want that to go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| I mean, if we're not finished, we can continue it, but have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| Well, from what I understand, Commissioner Mark Harmon has decided to not include that as part of his resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:22| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| You're talking about the real estate items that Commissioner Briggs was saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Unless there's a sense of the body to add it, I'm willing to just leave it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| The other thing is I accepted from Commissioner Pinkson the idea of 30 days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| I think the operation of the hearing should be done in accordance with the advice of the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:44| and giving substantial and sufficient time as needed, but without setting a huge volume of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| I think that's a more reasonable way to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| You know, I guess my question is are we going to retry the perjury charge about whether he really committed perjury or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| I guess the argument should be should a person that's been ousted and committed perjury, should they sit on a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| That's what the argument should be, not to retry the whole thing all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| I mean, really, one or two questions will establish the court record of the perjury conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| and then the question should become, and I hope the, in this case, Scott Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| will respond to the question of whether a person should be ousted based on this, because that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| Yeah, not to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Not to say, well, and despite the fact that the court said this, I mean, we have a court record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| We can point to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| I hope that the argument is about something other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Commissioner Ivanharm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| I appreciate Commissioner Harmon just sticking to the one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| and I guess my concern is does Mr. Moore have an opportunity to bring, say, character witnesses from the BZA board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| People can say he has done a good job on the BZA board, or has he done anything that they've seen that he needs to be kicked off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7916)|
| 2:12:04| And I think he needs to bring some witnesses for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| I think it would be, I think it should be part of his defense, whatever he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| And that's why I'm saying we should give him two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| And I believe that was accepted, 30 days and a two-day as amendment, a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| Again, I accepted the 30, and I think the amount of time necessary can be done at the time of the proceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| as outlined by the commission with the advice of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| I've got a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| We're giving him 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Is that 30 days for him to respond back to us, or are we going to have the hearing in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| Well, the way the statute reads, you send him written charges and you inform him of the date of the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7963)|
| 2:12:54| So in other words, the best way to do it would be the commission will consider within 30 days of the date of this letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7974)|
| 2:13:02| or soon thereafter whether or not you should continue to serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| I'm just talking stepperaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| If you set a date tonight, then you give him a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| Now, of course, if he contacts you and says, well, I'm out of country, I need a continuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| then you'll have to consider that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| But the idea is you give him a 30-day window and telling him on or about 30 days from the date of this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| there will be a hearing for you to give cause why you should remain on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| And if he asks for a continuance, I guess in order to grant that, we would have to vote on that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| Yes, you'd have to either during the next public meeting or call a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| Okay. Just trying to get down the procedures for everybody to know. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| But again, you know, the law director's office doesn't have a position one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| The only thing is I do believe because this secondary issue raised by Commissioner Briggs is in its infancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| and is undecided, I really do feel in terms of the spirit of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| you should stick to the underlying issues as articulated by Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| That's just, again, not fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Then you're saying we need to give him all the time that he needs instead of putting a two-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| I think we need to give him sufficient time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| I think it can be ruled upon by this body what a sufficient amount of time is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8063)|
| 2:14:30| depending on what issues are addressed when he comes back in his response to our letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| I think it would be premature to set aside, you know, three hours, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| Let's just find out what issues are resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| Maybe the person will choose to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| But whatever, let's not make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| I think we make it at the hearing allotting a sufficient amount of time and with the advice of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8087)|
| 2:14:54| I'll put a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| I guess my question is, are we saying that we'll come back next month and then set the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| or are we setting the date right now to be 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| So that at our next regular commission meeting, that will be the day of this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| I would suggest that our next commission meeting either, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| would be a very good time at which to do this because it would be outside the 30-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| and that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| The commission is free to choose another date, but that's my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| It's 30 days from now, which just happens to be a scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| I guess what I'm trying to get at, are we setting that date right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| or do we need to come back and set that a month from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| That's what I'm trying to get between you and the law director, to make sure that we're all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| Let's set it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| Let's set it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| If it passes, let's be setting it now for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| Let's make it after the next meeting, a day or two, a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| We have to have it because we're all going to be tired up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| You see how long we've been going here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| Tempers will be flaring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| Next meeting, April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| I suppose, yeah, if you want to set it for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| Say Tuesday or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| Within a week after the next meeting, it will be fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Setting a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| With a scheduling left up to the chairman within a week after the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Why don't you just make it after...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| Why don't we just say 45 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| After the agenda meeting, if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| Fine, at the agenda meeting, if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Or at the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| You know, something so that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| That's fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| It's March, it'll be April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| So for the May agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| It'll be like whatever the May agenda meeting is, like May 1 or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| It's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| It's a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Joe Lee, do you know what that date is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| May 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| May 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| May 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| It'll be May 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Okay, so you want to set that as the date that we'll have the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| If it passes, that would be the date at which the hearing would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Isn't that a holiday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| May the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Cinco de Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Wrong country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| Is everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| Mr. Chairman, I recuse myself at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| Just be aware, commissioners, as you know, just to reiterate, and you've heard this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| ad nauseum, but by recusing yourself, that likewise means you do not involve yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| in the proceedings whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| If you want to sit in the back of the room, fine, but if you're recusing yourself, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| don't participate in deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| I think some people get the impression they deliberate and then refrain from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| You will not participate in the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| That's what I intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| I just want to ensure, just for your protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| I'll be knocking on doors anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| No, you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| It's a day after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| May the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| I'll be picking up my signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| That's a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| The election will be on a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| Day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| Day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| Page 14, resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| a committee of community grant citizens panels for their important work in reminding the panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| that funding is ultimately the responsibility of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| Got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Commissioner Lambert, do you have anything you'd add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| Well, I just want to say, and I serve on one of these panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| and the work that these panels do is extremely important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| and I want to honor those of us who serve on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| but at the same time I want to remind folks that the budget is the Knox County Commission's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8347)|
| 2:19:16| and that while I believe that we have made some good recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| and I think that most of their, at least the panel I sat on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| I think that the rest of the commission will accept those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| Just reminding folks that the budget is the responsibility of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| and if there are things that are added or tweaked a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| that that's just the process, that we're at the beginning of the process rather than the end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| And one of the reasons why I bring this up is some of their most important arts and cultural organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:54| there were some paperwork snafus, and the grant panel did not even have an opportunity to hear from certain organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8394)|
| 2:20:03| I just think we need to reiterate that this commission has a right to hear from some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| that may have had paperwork problems and rightfully were not included in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| but that they have an opportunity to come and speak with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| I agree 100% with Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| In fact, I think Commissioner Smith was there last year at the orientation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:33| I mean, it's our responsibility to dole these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| We appreciate the grants panel digging in and giving us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| It's kind of like John Troy gives us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| They do the legwork, but ultimately it's our call how we're going to fund the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| So I think that that process, it's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| I think it's gotten better from, this will be my third one, it's getting better each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| But sometimes I think we end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| I think ultimately the goal of our community grants is to advance the county, to keep us up and prosperous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| And sometimes we need to step in and make some tweaks and some decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| And we're well within our responsibility of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| So I thank Commissioner Lambert for bringing this resolution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| I agree with the sentiment of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| And I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| I just don't think it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| I think that is already our responsibility and is known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| It's in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| So, I mean, if we need to reiterate it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| But it doesn't appear to me we really need to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| I mean, we're saying the obvious here to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| And I believe, Mr. Sanders, that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| There have been a couple of people that I have heard say, make comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| that commission needed to do exactly what the panels recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| I believe that they were expressing a minority opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| But what I don't want to happen is I don't want that opinion to be echoed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| and folks to lose touch with the idea that the budget is commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:19| I agree with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| I think it is dangerous for us to ask a panel of citizens to do something and then change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8541)|
| 2:22:30| I don't advocate changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| At least the panel I was on, I think we did a spectacular job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| Now, as a commissioner, I was a citizen when I sat on that panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| I was appointed by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| I did my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| But there were certain organizations that I didn't even have the opportunity to rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| simply because of paperwork issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| And now I'm sitting back in this seat and I'm a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| And as a county commissioner, for a few more meetings anyway, as a community leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| there are organizations that I believe that we need to take another look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| And I believe that this commission probably will when that time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| And I just want to remind folks that while we do a lot of hard work on those panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| and we do deserve to be honored with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| but at the same time a friendly reminder that the budget does belong to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| Grant, I've got a quick question for you if you'd come forward real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| I don't know if you know the answer to this or not, but a couple of years we had like $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| Last year I think we had millions, what Eric had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| How much money do you think we're going to have this year to dispense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| I think they'll end up being about $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| But keep in mind this year what we've done is we've taken some agencies out of the community grant pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| and put them into defined services, most notably a lot of our health-related agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8638)|
| 2:24:03| And our five historic homes actually we took out this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| and we're going to be funding them through a defined service contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| for the maintenance and preservation of those structures and those grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| But the overall number as far as the agencies are concerned will be about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| But as far as the community grant panels, the three separate panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| arts and cultural is going to be doling out $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| Homeless support services will be doling out $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| And then the general services panel will be doling out $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| So $850,000 total of the community grants panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| But keep in mind all those health-related agencies have been moved over to defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| Are your people putting in for grants, are they increasing or decreasing from years past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| The number of applicants, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| I'd have to look at last year's numbers and keep in mind I wasn't in charge of this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| This particular piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8701)|

| 2:26:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| Thank you, Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| There is some committee meeting in the next couple, three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| The Procurement Committee is meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| Does that sound correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| I believe I'm a member of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| I have that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Probably three or four others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| This will be something to be considered and looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Does anyone have any concerns that they need to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| I know this is, you know, is there any other discussion to make sure that people cover certain things out of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8788)|
| 2:26:36| out of the committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| I would like to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| I missed the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| But I was of the understanding that this would go to the Procurement Committee prior to a reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| And I understand that the day, I don't have it on my calendar right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| that the Procurement Committee meeting was scheduled was the day that Hugh Holt would be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| And I think it would be very helpful if he were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| I think the Procurement Committee is supposed to meet immediately after the next Intergovernmental Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| I don't know if Hugh is in town or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Mr. Holt is going to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| Then I think we need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| Well, we can reschedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Let's reschedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| In other words, I would rather look at a recommendation from the committee regarding this prior to doing a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:27| Well, I serve as chairman of the procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| I'll just reset it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| Can we postpone this then until the committee is met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| Well, this is just on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| So we could, you know, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| I mean, you can ask for it to be deferred until after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| Mr. Sanders, this amendment was to go ahead and vote for it on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| and then to come out and look at what the Procurement Committee says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| And then have second reading next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| I mean, that was what was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| That was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| I believe that both committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| I missed the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| Well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| I mean, you've earned every right to ask for it to be deferred if that's the motion you wish to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| Yes, I would prefer that we put this off until after the committee, the Procurement Committee has come back with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| and then have a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| We have a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| At least I need a better understanding of what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| Is there anybody here from the administration that can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| if there's a reason why they might want to go ahead and have it heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| I think that Hugh wanted to wait until after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| During our subcommittee meeting, or committee meeting, I think that it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| I was under the impression we're going to meet or read it after the Procurement Committee met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| and make sure we didn't have any unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| So do you want to make a motion to defer until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| I'll make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| But we'll have the, I'm going to set that before we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Before we meet next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| So if you want to make a motion to defer until 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| 30 days, yes, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| Substitute motion to defer this item for 30 days and to have the Procurement Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| Actually, it should be for both these items, for item 102 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| Well, we'll read that into the minutes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| So let's just take care of this one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| Do I hear a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| Got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=8967)|

| 2:31:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9060)|

| 2:31:02| Commissioner Lambert, is your light on to speak to this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| Actually, I want to bring a motion to the previous thing that we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| We can get to that in just a moment, okay, if we can get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9075)|

| 2:31:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| One question I have is, once again, I missed the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| What is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| The amendment is 2-281.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| That was a housekeeping item that John Troyer brought us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| It was an accounting standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| Okay, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| It was inverted and left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| It's more belt and suspenders kind of approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9104)|

| 2:31:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9108)|

| 2:31:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| Yes, I have Scott Moore on the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| He would like to do this sometime in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| He's going to be out of town in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| He needs a couple of weeks, he says, but sometime in the middle of April would work better for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| Can we bring something up to reconsider the dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I couldn't make the motion to reconsider to change the dates because I was not on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:27| It would have to be someone on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| What about tax day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| What about tax day, April 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| About April 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| It's a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| Mr. McKenzie says that's a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| How long do you think it will take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| Two or three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| I'm thinking we always do things after intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| Do I need to make a motion to reconsider since I was on the prevailing side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| Make a motion to reconsider the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9186)|
| 2:33:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Now, I believe Mr. Law Director takes a two-thirds vote of this body to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9188)|
| 2:33:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9195)|

| 2:36:11| Yeah, we just referred it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| All that I've got to report is that at the last stormwater ordinance review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9376)|
| 2:36:23| MPC presented and we discussed the planning process that the MPC is involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9383)|
| 2:36:32| and changes to that process or discussed some of the changes that might be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:38| in addressing water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| So we're continuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9400)|

| 2:36:52| But we're still in the data, kind of data collection phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| and will be for a little bit before we start to analyze our information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| and make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9421)|

| 2:37:10| I'm inquiring about the status of 904, the public safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| Did I just miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| Because I believe we're going to be deferring it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| Did I miss that or did we skip that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| It was deferred by both committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Because it was deferred by both committees, we didn't need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9445)|

| 2:37:48| and we have had an overwhelming positive response about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| So I'm pleased and encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part2?start=9471)|
