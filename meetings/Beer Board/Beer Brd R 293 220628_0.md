| 0:01:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| All right. Today's agenda includes 11 beer permit applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| 6 addendum items, and 1 administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| When I call your name of the business or organization applying for the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| please come to the podium, state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| into the microphone for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| need to bring their completed documents to the business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| during regular business hours, which are 8 to 4.30, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| And applicants who have their permit approved tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| can pick up their permit at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| So first up, we have Asian Culture Center of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| which I think has asked to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Do we know how long to the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| I think the July meeting was her preference, July 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Okay. So Asian Culture has asked to be postponed to the July beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| I have a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Next up is Cumberland House of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| which I also think has asked to be deferred. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| They familiar refrain, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| All right. Did they state for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| There too, that they hope to be in order by next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| By July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| By July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| All right. Do I have a motion to approve Cumberland House moving to the July agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| All right. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| All right. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Next, we have Danger Company, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| Welcome to beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| If you'd like to state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Yeah. Joshua Moore, 605 Sevier Avenue, Suite B, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| All right. Can you tell us a little bit about your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Yeah. We're just opening a neighborhood bar slash event space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| And we were only going to do beer until city engineering came back and said that there's a daycare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| within the 300-foot proximity to our corner of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| So I'm here, but I've got to apply for a full liquor license to override that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| So we're in the process of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| So I guess I kind of want to know if there's anything you can give me any insight on where I go from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| aside from just completing that and then how that works with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Okay. Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Council Member Ryder was asking me about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Assuming all the other criteria can be met, it would be appropriate to approve pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=253)|
| 0:04:23| which must include the TABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Okay. So at this point, Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Mr. Burr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| We would need a copy of the sales tax registration, corporate charter, building inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| fire prevention, health department approvals, and then that TABC liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Okay. So I bring all that back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| You would bring all that and submit it to Mr. Burr's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Burr's office. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| So I wouldn't have to go in front of the July meeting as long as I button all this up in the next couple of weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| As long as we approve pending final documentation, which that being the case, I will ask for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| All right. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| All right. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| So, yes, bring all of that back to the business tax office during those hours when you have it pulled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| It should be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Okay. Working around the clock for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| All right. Best of luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| When do you expect to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=332)|

| 0:05:34| When do you expect to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=334)|

| 0:05:43| I don't know how fast TABC works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| But construction-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| I've just got a couple things to button up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| My general contractor has got a call in to James Tente about getting a walk-through and just giving us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| let me know if I need to tidy anything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=360)|

| 0:06:08| So I think we're on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| We've just got a couple more days of plugging away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=370)|

| 0:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=389)|

| 0:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| I will say one of the last ones we extended was way more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| So if you do it in 23, that will be a year and some change for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| I guess the only question we have is, so I see there's, this isn't my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| I didn't push my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| We've done with other ones in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| We made them redo their fingerprints when it's outside of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| And I think I see, is it each owner has to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| They've done that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Anybody over 5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Mr. Frost, if we were to extend out to the February meeting in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| but ask the applicant to resubmit their fingerprints and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| would that be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| I mean, at this point, once 90 days has passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| there's no compulsion for the beer board to extend the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| So, you know, they might want to hear the recommendation of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| to do the process again, or if they come up the next time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| the beer board might not extend them anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| then they would have to start the process all over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| which would include fingerprint and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| You know, this is a common occurrence with Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| I've done this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| I've talked about it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I guess this gentleman, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| they want to get the ball rolling on their beer permit as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| in case there is a business that comes in next door to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Like you saw the gentleman from Danger Company Inc. earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| he had a distance problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| so that gentleman is having to go through the TABC permit, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Weigel's is concerned about similar distance issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| so they would rather start on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| and not have to go through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| but the result of that is it takes them a while and they come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| So is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| That is absolutely correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Well, I'd be comfortable with giving you an extension to the time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| that you expect to be complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| but it has been the course of this beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| to ask for resubmittal of those fingerprints and that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| If that's something you can agree to do voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| then I think we can make that motion to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Yes, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I'll make a motion to extend to the February 2023 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Wilson Corner Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Chair Tessman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| I've heard from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Their equipment has come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| They're just now waiting for their inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| and I think they've communicated with Mr. Byrd as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| So given that information in your conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| 30 days is what was requested, does that seem feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| or should we extend further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I'm always an advocate of extra time just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| He did say 30, he felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Well, let's extend this one for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| So I have a motion to extend to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| All right, Yeehaw Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| Welcome to Beer Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| My name is Charles Ellis, 745 North Broadway, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It's a large project, and like so many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| there's supply chain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| We're building two roof structures in our new beer garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| that require structural steel, and they've been hard to source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| So from an extension, is there a timeline that you're comfortable with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| If 120 days is possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| I think that would be well within what we'd be hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I just want to say I've spoken with Mr. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| They've been before us for an extension before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| This is the former, well, Elkmont in the 4th District there on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| He just, as we asked at last meeting, just did his updated fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| So this one will be well outside the 12 months, but he just did those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| So in anticipation of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| So I'm going to make a motion to extend for 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| and I believe you said you're waiting on steel for the roof structures when we spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Thanks very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| We will move now to our administrative hearing, which is Hat Makers Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1369)|
| 0:23:09| Jason Hat Maker, 2917 Tazewell Park, Hat Makers Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| So on May 13th of this year, you were in receipt of a TABC order of summary suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| On May 17th, agreed order reached between TABC and the permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| And on May 18th, notice of beer board hearing sent and received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| Can you just share a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Sort of give us an explanation on what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| What we did, I had my liquor license suspended for 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| We made a new security plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| We added outdoor video cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| We put on the windows no cuts, no colors, no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| We already had the doorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Most of our security plan was in place, but we paid a $1,500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| and it was suspended for 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Anything else that you'd like to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| Well, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Yeah, so could you explain, you just said there's a sign that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| tell me again what you said the sign said, no cuts, no colors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| No exceptions, yes, that's a motorcycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Tell me what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| That's a motorcycle club thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| We're not accepting them to come in with any of their vest on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| or any of their support craft or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| What's support craft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| It means where they come in and say I support the outlaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| or I support whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Identifying which group they're with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| You're Mr. Hatmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Are you Mr. Hatmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| So I just want to, for the record for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| to read a couple of things that were in the TABC complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| for the hearing that you had with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| The calls for service in 2022 alone, there were ten disturbances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| two assaults, one fight, one hit and run, two warrant services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| four thefts, four officer investigations, three suspicious persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| four disorderly conduct, one missing person, one deceased person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and one shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| And I'm not sure that includes the shooting that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| I believe it was in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Yes, it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| And I have those call records also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Sure, it's in the complaint from TABC that they provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Well, I mean, I called the 911 dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Mine doesn't equal out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| I'm not saying that that's what you have is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| But I've tried to get all my stuff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| I've tried to look at all the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Some of these calls say default at the end of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| which I believe that means that they came out and not found any findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| I don't know exactly who's calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| I had a call came in this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| I had the officer came in to me, told me that there was no findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| and he didn't believe that a call should have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| But yet a call was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Well, I'm going to make a motion to send this to a revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| which is the action that we can take here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| The last incident involved, I believe, two people who were shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| One person was deceased at the back of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Two people fled through the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| and that was just one of the incidences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| There were two people that fled through the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| that abut your establishment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| During this recent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| I was not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| According to eyewitnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Yeah, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Who are afraid to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| I just want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| There's a lot of fear in the neighborhood and a lot of anger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| and I've gotten a lot of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| So I'm going to make a motion to refer this to a revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| I just want to echo the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| It sounds like some of the patrons that frequent your establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| have gang affiliations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| It also goes on to state that on April 29, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| the two men were found deceased in the parking lot immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| in front of the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| There was a fight inside, a physical altercation in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| that moved to the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Ultimately, two deceased individuals were both shot in the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Two other individuals were also shot during the altercation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| This is very concerning on a lot of different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| I know that you're sharing with us that you're taking more security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| measures, but bullets don't have eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| And so as Council Member Ryder just shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| there are people that are in the community around your establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| that are afraid to even speak out openly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| not necessarily because of you but because of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| your patrons of your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| And so with that said, I am in total agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| I think that there are some serious things that are going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| especially when there are gangs that are coming to establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| and congregating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| And that's hard to control regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| And I think we're very fortunate that there have not probably been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| any more fatalities due to that congregation of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| So I'm in full favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Those people that showed up that this happens, very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| We don't condone anything like that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| But they have never been inside my establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| They just came, showed up, happened in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| That's between whatever those people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| I don't understand why it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I wish it wouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Obviously, everybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| But I don't know what I could have done to prevent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| or how I even am responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| But they showed up at my place to do what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and I couldn't stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Nobody could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Have you considered hiring off-duty security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| I'm sorry, I can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Have you considered hiring off-duty security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Well, I have a doorman that's there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| You know, I don't think the off-duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| not that it's saying that's not a good suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| but I don't think, I mean, there was supposedly dozens of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| that came on these people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| So I don't know what would have stopped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| It's some kind of altercation that they have been between each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I mean, I know that I, too, have gotten a number of calls and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| Yeah, I think I get a security plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| but you might think more about the breadth of having more security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| I mean, a doorman, but I'm not sure a doorman can really control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| what seems to be happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Council Member McKee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| I have another question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Mr. Frost, I know that there have been establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| that have been shut down due to what's considered a public nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Could you give us what that definition is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| Well, that's proceeding under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| and that involves the district attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| They would confer with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| but that's not something within the realm of this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Yeah, so we have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Mr. Hatmaker, I just wanted to clarify that the KPD report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| that's in the TABC documents does not match what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| That is correct, it does not match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| That statement that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| So your claim is none of these individuals ever come to your bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| they're just always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| I'm saying what that statement says in that paperwork right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| says that the argument started inside the bar, then it got violent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| then it went outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| That is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| Okay, well, there's no action that we can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| other than send it to the revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| so I'm just going to leave it at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| and let you discuss that with that hearing officer at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| The police report doesn't say anything about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| but I don't know where they get their information to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Yeah, I do not know where they got it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Okay, well, I will ask Chief Knoll for a copy of the police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| I just know what before this incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I know all the phone calls and complaints I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| that involve, I think, every Friday night for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| So, you know, I have to look out not only for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| but also for neighbors, and as Councilwoman McKenzie just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| bullets don't have eyes, and there's a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| afraid to come outside of their homes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| And there are people that live even further than right next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| in the perimeter that are afraid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and that's impacting other businesses around there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| So I'm not an expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| I don't know how to get to the bottom of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| I don't know why these people are attracted to the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| of your establishment, but that's pretty concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| All right, I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| All those in favor of sending this to a revocation hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| So you'll receive a notice in probably the next week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| on when that hearing will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| You said I'll receive it next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| You'll probably receive it within the next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| All right, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| I think a member of El Ranchero is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=1995)|
| 0:33:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| All right, apparently I guess we'll need to move to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| I tried to surreptitiously text all the numbers I could find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| from the file, but no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I thought we were on the same page last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Do we want to make a motion to send El Ranchero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| to the July meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| All right, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| All right, if there's no further business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| then this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220628?start=2042)|
