| 0:12:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=746.0)|
| 0:12:29| Discussion item regarding Knox County Health Department's new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=749.0)|
| 0:12:32| requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=752.0)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=755.0)|
| 0:12:36| This is something that Commissioner Schoonmaker asked to have added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=756.0)|
| 0:12:39| to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=759.0)|
| 0:12:41| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:45| So just my understanding is the Knox County Health Department is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=765.0)|
| 0:12:48| not going to do the inspections for the beer permits in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=768.0)|
| 0:12:53| as of April, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=773.0)|
| 0:12:56| Is that still correct, Kathy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=776.0)|
| 0:13:00| It is and it ain't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=780.0)|
| 0:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=784.0)|
| 0:13:05| It's like the grocery stores and gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=785.0)|
| 0:13:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=789.0)|
| 0:13:10| They have to go through the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=790.0)|
| 0:13:14| But if it's like a restaurant or an in-skip grill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=794.0)|
| 0:13:19| then the Health Department does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=799.0)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=802.0)|
| 0:13:23| And the reason is the state had allowed the Health Department with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=803.0)|
| 0:13:28| Knox County to conduct all of the inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=808.0)|
| 0:13:32| and now they've rescinded that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=812.0)|
| 0:13:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=815.0)|
| 0:13:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=816.0)|
| 0:13:37| So you will have a list when they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=817.0)|
| 0:13:44| as a restaurant and a health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=824.0)|
| 0:13:47| Knox County Health Department inspects that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=827.0)|
| 0:13:49| you'll have a list of if they've completed that inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=829.0)|
| 0:13:53| whereas if it's a gas station or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=833.0)|
| 0:13:58| the state would have to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=838.0)|
| 0:14:01| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=841.0)|
| 0:14:02| As of today, I had one from a convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:07| and it's just a letter that they send to the customer which states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=847.0)|
| 0:14:12| that it's not approved, but it's okay for me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=852.0)|
| 0:14:17| for them to get their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=857.0)|
| 0:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=859.0)|
| 0:14:20| I'll bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=860.0)|
| 0:14:22| But that was just the main thing was last month we were a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=862.0)|
| 0:14:25| confused on why we weren't getting a reaction from the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=865.0)|
| 0:14:29| Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=869.0)|
| 0:14:30| and now they're not responsible for a portion of our beer applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=870.0)|
| 0:14:36| We just want to make sure the whole team understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=876.0)|

| 0:14:48| and the Health Department did actually send us a letter in regard to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=888.0)|
| 0:14:53| item today about what their process was or was not on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=893.0)|
| 0:14:59| And so there won't be a representative from the Health Department at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=899.0)|

| 0:29:33| So that being said, the way the Code provides that, that has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1773.0)|
| 0:29:37| done in a court of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1777.0)|
| 0:29:38| And I'm not saying that we have the authority to do that, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1778.0)|
| 0:29:42| sort of taking a generalization of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1782.0)|
| 0:29:44| Well, I think you've seen a situation I actually have represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1784.0)|

| 0:29:51| folks, I represented a number of establishments with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1791.0)|

| 0:30:07| Now, the particular establishment that you're talking about, most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1807.0)|
| 0:30:10| of the time when you file an Attorney General's action and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1810.0)|
| 0:30:13| see it brought, the establishments really don't fight it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1813.0)|
| 0:30:17| of the financial burden associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1817.0)|
| 0:30:20| So you see those type of situations where they get closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1820.0)|
| 0:30:24| So you will see basically injunctions and things issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1824.0)|
| 0:30:27| associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1827.0)|

| 0:30:36| level of a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1836.0)|
| 0:30:38| It is obviously a concern, but in those nuisance cases that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1838.0)|
| 0:30:41| dealt with, particularly in the city of Knoxville where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1841.0)|
| 0:30:45| dealt with those type situations, obviously the first line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1845.0)|
| 0:30:49| defense is the attempt to ameliorate with security personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1849.0)|
| 0:30:52| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1852.0)|
| 0:30:53| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1853.0)|
| 0:30:54| Yeah, I'm clearly not trying to say that this board has the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1854.0)|
| 0:30:57| sort of nuisance powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1857.0)|

| 0:31:14| We constantly fight for the rights of people to open business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1874.0)|

| 0:31:32| But I wonder how is it, how do you convince this board that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1892.0)|

| 0:32:21| submit to you that there is significant information there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1941.0)|

| 0:33:05| We're going to have uniformed officers there in the parking lot, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1985.0)|
| 0:33:08| think that will alleviate this type of situation, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=1988.0)|

| 0:33:44| So the reassurance that I can give you is that they are doing all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2024.0)|
| 0:33:47| they can within the bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2027.0)|

| 0:35:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2142.0)|
| 0:35:43| It's too big to copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2143.0)|
| 0:35:44| But do you see why, I mean, why I would not, I may be compelled to revoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2144.0)|
| 0:35:49| the license if they're able to conduct a profitable business with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2149.0)|
| 0:35:54| incidents occurring like those that we continue to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2154.0)|
| 0:35:59| I don't have a compelling argument to allow this business to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2159.0)|
| 0:36:04| I think you do because of the fact that it was beyond their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2164.0)|
| 0:36:08| How was that incident, if you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2168.0)|
| 0:36:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:11| You tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2171.0)|
| 0:36:12| There were no incidents reported while the beer permit was suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2172.0)|
| 0:36:15| We could have a shooting out here in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2175.0)|
| 0:36:17| So you can argue both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2177.0)|
| 0:36:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2178.0)|
| 0:36:19| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2179.0)|
| 0:36:20| But how do you have a shooting out here in a parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2180.0)|
| 0:36:22| One car is down the street in here and somebody, excuse me, somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:26| discharges a firearm into the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2186.0)|
| 0:36:28| You're holding the business owner responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2188.0)|
| 0:36:30| They didn't condone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2190.0)|
| 0:36:32| They didn't encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2192.0)|
| 0:36:33| They didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2193.0)|
| 0:36:35| So that being said, any time that we have somebody discharge a firearm in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2195.0)|
| 0:36:39| the air or something of that nature, then we're going to sit there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2199.0)|
| 0:36:42| we're going to take a putative action against a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2202.0)|
| 0:36:45| Yeah, they managed to survive with regards to a profitable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2205.0)|
| 0:36:49| You know, profitable means you keep the doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2209.0)|
| 0:36:51| But as far as the beer actually having the permit and the folks that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2211.0)|
| 0:36:55| going there and enjoying their food, enjoying entertainment and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2215.0)|
| 0:36:59| obviously, yes, they like to enjoy a beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2219.0)|
| 0:37:02| So there's no question with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2222.0)|
| 0:37:04| So, yeah, that is a significant part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2224.0)|
| 0:37:06| It is crippling to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2226.0)|
| 0:37:08| They are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2228.0)|
| 0:37:10| Well, I appreciate your response and your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2230.0)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2233.0)|
| 0:37:14| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2234.0)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:17| Lieutenant Walker, do you have knowledge of what kind of liquor permit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2237.0)|
| 0:37:24| they have from Alcohol Beverage Control, what it's classified as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2244.0)|
| 0:37:29| They do have a license from the ABC board, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2249.0)|
| 0:37:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2251.0)|
| 0:37:32| Is it a license for a bar only or as a restaurant that sells alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2252.0)|
| 0:37:39| The last I knew it was for a restaurant establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2259.0)|
| 0:37:43| Are they still required to have a certain percentage of restaurant sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2263.0)|
| 0:37:47| to alcohol sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2267.0)|
| 0:37:49| That is my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2269.0)|
| 0:37:50| Like a 50-50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2270.0)|
| 0:37:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2272.0)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2274.0)|
| 0:37:55| So the state would verify through their Department of Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2275.0)|
| 0:37:59| that they are actually hitting that requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2279.0)|
| 0:38:04| They were fined last year, 2022, for not meeting those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2284.0)|
| 0:38:11| As far as what they've done this year, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2291.0)|
| 0:38:14| They were fined $1,500 by TABC recently for failure to maintain law and order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2294.0)|
| 0:38:20| for the May 7th incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2300.0)|
| 0:38:24| When you say recently, was there a date on that at all or just 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2304.0)|
| 0:38:28| The citation was for the incident that occurred May 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2308.0)|
| 0:38:34| failure to maintain law and order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2314.0)|
| 0:38:36| But that's the only thing they've done through the state with their liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2316.0)|
| 0:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2324.0)|
| 0:38:45| So the Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Control is aware of their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2325.0)|
| 0:38:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2333.0)|
| 0:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2334.0)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2335.0)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2338.0)|
| 0:38:59| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2339.0)|
| 0:39:01| Officers, can you just remind me what the conclusion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2341.0)|
| 0:39:04| to the underage rape allegation that happened inside the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2344.0)|
| 0:39:09| It was determined by the detective working the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2349.0)|
| 0:39:12| that it was reported a month after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2352.0)|
| 0:39:15| So there was no forensic evidence was not able to be obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2355.0)|
| 0:39:20| He did go to the bar and request surveillance video footage of the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2360.0)|
| 0:39:24| and they informed him that they didn't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2364.0)|
| 0:39:27| So at this point, the underage girl, 16, was in the bar by her own admission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2367.0)|
| 0:39:34| had been drinking, and was taken out into the parking lot by an unknown male| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2374.0)|
| 0:39:39| and raped in the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2379.0)|
| 0:39:45| Well, you know, obviously we take great exception to that with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2385.0)|
| 0:39:48| You can't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2388.0)|
| 0:39:49| You can come into my car wash and ask me for a video that I've got 30 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2389.0)|
| 0:39:53| I'm not going to be able to produce it because it's electronically re-recorded over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2393.0)|
| 0:39:57| just simply because of the data storage ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2397.0)|
| 0:40:00| So indicating that that's uncooperative with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2400.0)|
| 0:40:03| the fact that you don't have it, that's commonplace in any business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2403.0)|
| 0:40:06| associated therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2406.0)|
| 0:40:08| And the statements of an individual, they're exactly that, hearsay statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2408.0)|
| 0:40:12| It's just like somebody makes an allegation some 30 or 40 days later against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2412.0)|
| 0:40:17| It becomes very difficult to defend the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2417.0)|
| 0:40:20| What basically ought to be part and parcel of the fact that the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2420.0)|
| 0:40:23| Attorney General's Office, the agency assessed with prosecution of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2423.0)|
| 0:40:27| chose not to prosecute the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2427.0)|
| 0:40:29| The same thing happened with regards to where we have this one dude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2429.0)|
| 0:40:33| and two women fight in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2433.0)|
| 0:40:35| There's no charges out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2435.0)|
| 0:40:37| Nothing arose out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2437.0)|
| 0:40:39| And the only charge that arose since we've been back here is this discharge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2439.0)|
| 0:40:43| the firearm in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2443.0)|
| 0:40:45| In El Tequila, our personnel, our folks, our security personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2445.0)|
| 0:40:48| participated in the actual prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2448.0)|
| 0:40:51| We're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2451.0)|
| 0:40:52| We're the one who identifies him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2452.0)|
| 0:40:54| We're the one who gets him prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2454.0)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2459.0)|
| 0:41:00| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2460.0)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2462.0)|
| 0:41:05| This business is a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2465.0)|
| 0:41:08| It's the only business that is open out there at these operating hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2468.0)|
| 0:41:12| except maybe for the pizza place next door that is a delivery-only pizza shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2472.0)|
| 0:41:19| So the case of this wouldn't happen if we have new security and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2479.0)|
| 0:41:28| it doesn't happen because the 90 days that they were suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2488.0)|
| 0:41:32| as Commissioner Frazier says, there was no issues at all, none whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2492.0)|
| 0:41:38| And just as soon as we gave them back their beer permit, we have this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2498.0)|
| 0:41:43| and the answer to the fight was push them out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2503.0)|
| 0:41:49| Get them out of our office, get them out of our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2509.0)|
| 0:41:52| and push them out the door where there's no security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2512.0)|
| 0:41:56| There was, instead of controlling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2516.0)|
| 0:41:59| if the gentleman's not here, that was their security, I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2519.0)|
| 0:42:03| Instead of him controlling it inside the business, he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2523.0)|
| 0:42:06| My question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2526.0)|
| 0:42:08| Mr. Law Director, what's our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2528.0)|
| 0:42:13| Well, this board has essentially plenary authority to maintain, revoke, suspend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2533.0)|
| 0:42:20| or impose a fine on any business that's operating in contravention of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2540.0)|
| 0:42:25| and the local beer regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2545.0)|
| 0:42:28| Specifically, you can look at Section 4.8 or 4-8 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2548.0)|
| 0:42:33| which is essentially a reworking of a similar statute in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2553.0)|
| 0:42:38| Subparagraph G says revocation, suspension, or imposition of civil penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2558.0)|
| 0:42:43| may be made for any violation of any provision of this article or chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2563.0)|
| 0:42:50| or whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that the premises of any person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2570.0)|
| 0:42:55| firm, or corporation holding a permit under this article are being maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2575.0)|
| 0:42:59| and operated in such a manner as to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2579.0)|
| 0:43:04| So your authority is fairly broad here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2584.0)|
| 0:43:12| We've heard these matters before, so I think you have a fair amount of discretion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2592.0)|
| 0:43:18| Respectfully, if we're going to turn this from what we're invited to as a discussion to a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2598.0)|
| 0:43:23| and we're going to deal with somebody's license associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2603.0)|
| 0:43:26| I think any action of the board, at least at this point in time, would be arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2606.0)|
| 0:43:30| I would ask that we be given the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2610.0)|
| 0:43:34| If we want to have a full hearing associated, we'll drag them all down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2614.0)|
| 0:43:37| We'll drag the rape victim down here. We'll drag the DA down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:40| We'll drag everybody down here, and they can testify about all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2620.0)|
| 0:43:44| We throw all this mud, and we talk about, quote, unquote, a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2624.0)|
| 0:43:49| But let's talk about all these other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2629.0)|
| 0:43:52| Let's talk about all the other bars in Knox County that are having fights and everything of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2632.0)|
| 0:43:56| and let's look at the charges associated with them, and then let's single this one out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2636.0)|
| 0:44:00| Let's do that, but let's drag them all down there and have a full hearing associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2640.0)|
| 0:44:05| So that being said, we were invited down here, and that's why I prefaced my correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2645.0)|
| 0:44:09| that I attached in your packets with the fact that we're invited down here to a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2649.0)|
| 0:44:14| I didn't think we were basically coming to a situation of a lynching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2654.0)|
| 0:44:17| and that's basically what I feel we're facing with regards to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2657.0)|
| 0:44:21| We've got a business that's bending over backwards trying to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2661.0)|
| 0:44:25| trying to police, trying to do what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2665.0)|
| 0:44:29| We've asked local law enforcement that are serving in other bars and other establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2669.0)|
| 0:44:33| across the county and across the city, and they won't come there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2673.0)|
| 0:44:37| but yet we're going to be vilified associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2677.0)|
| 0:44:40| So that's what my issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2680.0)|
| 0:44:42| So if we're going to have a full-blown hearing, let's have a full-blown hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2682.0)|
| 0:44:46| but not take just arbitrary and capricious action with regards to what I consider to be the lifeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2686.0)|
| 0:44:51| to this business as far as their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2691.0)|
| 0:44:54| We understand it's a privilege, and we understand that you have the power to revoke the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2694.0)|
| 0:44:58| but that causes me really particular grave concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2698.0)|
| 0:45:02| because we have just these broad allegations relative to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2702.0)|
| 0:45:05| We have a rape that's not prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2705.0)|
| 0:45:07| You know what a rape that's not prosecuted is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2707.0)|
| 0:45:09| It's not a crime. It is not a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2709.0)|
| 0:45:11| You don't get to sit there and indict a business for something that's not prosecuted on their premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2711.0)|
| 0:45:17| You know what a fight is that's not basically indicted, that's not prosecuted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2717.0)|
| 0:45:21| It, for all intents and purposes, legally didn't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2721.0)|
| 0:45:25| And that's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2725.0)|
| 0:45:27| You look at this myriad of these just charges that get leveled against this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2727.0)|
| 0:45:32| and for the most part, they're traffic stops that occur on Maynardville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2732.0)|
| 0:45:37| in proximity to this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2737.0)|
| 0:45:39| But we're going to saddle this business with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2739.0)|
| 0:45:42| I don't think that's what this board's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2742.0)|
| 0:45:45| I think this board is about basically according due process to everyone that comes before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2745.0)|
| 0:45:50| and I don't think El Tequila is getting due process under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2750.0)|
| 0:46:00| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2760.0)|
| 0:46:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2762.0)|
| 0:46:04| Our agenda item 7 says discussion and possible vote on El Tequila Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2764.0)|
| 0:46:10| So it's properly noticed that there would be a discussion and possible vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2770.0)|
| 0:46:15| Yes, I concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2775.0)|
| 0:46:20| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2780.0)|
| 0:46:23| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2783.0)|
| 0:46:28| In compliance with due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2788.0)|
| 0:46:33| just having this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2793.0)|
| 0:46:36| have we not given them due process and the opportunity to have a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2796.0)|
| 0:46:41| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2801.0)|
| 0:46:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2803.0)|
| 0:46:45| The way this would go is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2805.0)|
| 0:46:47| If something were to happen to the license and the owners of the bar were to challenge it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2807.0)|
| 0:46:52| it would be challenged via a writ of certiorari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2812.0)|
| 0:46:56| It's a fancy word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2816.0)|
| 0:46:57| It basically means that the record that's made here would be transmitted to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2817.0)|
| 0:47:02| The court would look at the transcript, any other evidence that's been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2822.0)|
| 0:47:06| I can't recall if you've provided the list of the other offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2826.0)|
| 0:47:12| or incidents that have occurred at this establishment to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2832.0)|
| 0:47:18| I know there's been some discussion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2838.0)|
| 0:47:20| I don't know whether we've had a written submission of the incidences that you've based your reports on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2840.0)|
| 0:47:27| But the court will look at what has been presented to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2847.0)|
| 0:47:32| and determine whether or not there is material evidence to support what the body did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2852.0)|
| 0:47:38| We've got the sworn testimony of the beer board inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2858.0)|
| 0:47:42| We've gotten the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2862.0)|
| 0:47:45| I have seen cases where it's been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2865.0)|
| 0:47:48| that if you don't have direct notice of what the incident is that results in the revocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2868.0)|
| 0:47:56| that can be a reason to suspend if you wanted to act out of an abundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2876.0)|
| 0:48:04| You could re-notice this and say it's for this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2884.0)|
| 0:48:08| But honestly, I don't think there's anybody in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2888.0)|
| 0:48:13| It's clear that Mr. Jones knew what he was going to be talking about when he came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2893.0)|
| 0:48:18| I think everybody knew that we were going to be primarily focused on this May 7th incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2898.0)|
| 0:48:26| At the end of the day, is that enough for a court to uphold it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2906.0)|
| 0:48:31| We'd have to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2911.0)|
| 0:48:33| But we do have sworn testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2913.0)|
| 0:48:35| We really don't have a denial that the fight and the shooting took place on or near the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2915.0)|
| 0:48:43| We have a list of prior incidences that have occurred that have been placed in our record before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2923.0)|
| 0:48:53| So as far as due process, I think due process has been served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2933.0)|
| 0:49:01| Is there enough in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2941.0)|
| 0:49:03| That remains to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2943.0)|
| 0:49:04| I'd have to, you know, we'd put it in front of a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2944.0)|
| 0:49:07| and the judge would have to determine whether there's sufficient evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2947.0)|
| 0:49:10| So I would say that it's a pretty high bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2950.0)|
| 0:49:14| Like I said, the court can't look at what you did and decide what you did is right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2954.0)|
| 0:49:20| That's not the court's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2960.0)|
| 0:49:22| The court's role is to determine did you have a rational basis for what you did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2962.0)|
| 0:49:27| Did you have material evidence to support what you did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2967.0)|
| 0:49:30| And if the court finds that you did, then generally the court has no choice but to uphold what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2970.0)|
| 0:49:36| So that's my best statement of law and how the review would go if there's a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2976.0)|
| 0:49:43| Now it's up to you guys what you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2983.0)|
| 0:49:46| Well, I will say that I do not want this kind of activity going on in halls, but I do agree with Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2986.0)|
| 0:49:55| I have some questions on the due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2995.0)|
| 0:49:58| The allegations on the rape at this point, they are allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=2998.0)|
| 0:50:02| The allegations between this boyfriend and two girlfriends at this point, it is allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3002.0)|
| 0:50:07| The only thing that we know for sure is that there was a shooting and that person has pled guilty to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3007.0)|
| 0:50:13| and that happened in the parking lot of El Tequilo, and they asked them to leave the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3013.0)|
| 0:50:20| And I think, I mean, I'm a constitutional person, and I think they're entitled to due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3020.0)|
| 0:50:27| and I do not feel that they've had an adequate hearing to address these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3027.0)|
| 0:50:32| and I would make a motion that we set this for hearing if we're going to do any kind of action like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3032.0)|
| 0:50:40| We have a motion on the floor. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3040.0)|
| 0:50:49| Motion by Lee, second by Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3049.0)|
| 0:50:53| Ms. Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3053.0)|
| 0:50:56| I did have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3056.0)|
| 0:50:58| I have to say I feel like that, and I'm not an attorney, so I'm just coming at it as a layperson, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3058.0)|
| 0:51:09| but in my opinion, I believe this restaurant, we have given more than due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3069.0)|
| 0:51:14| They've been in front of us numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3074.0)|
| 0:51:17| I believe the sheriff's office has offered us ample information and opportunity to know what's going on in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3077.0)|
| 0:51:25| As somebody also said, they haven't denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3085.0)|
| 0:51:28| We even, because they had gotten an attorney prior to you, Mr. Jones, that came before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3088.0)|
| 0:51:36| and he said he had just gotten the case and he didn't have time for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3096.0)|
| 0:51:40| and we felt like that was due process, that we needed to give him more time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3100.0)|
| 0:51:44| And then in the meantime, we're having all of these issues coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3104.0)|
| 0:51:47| so I'm not even bringing up the rape or any of the other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3107.0)|
| 0:51:51| I'm bringing up that there are problems at this business, there continues to be problems at this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3111.0)|
| 0:51:57| but if you as their attorney are saying it's like a driver's license and it's a privilege to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3117.0)|
| 0:52:04| we as this board, I mean, I believe that I can say I have heard from this restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3124.0)|
| 0:52:10| more than I've heard from any other restaurant in Knox County since I've been sitting on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3130.0)|
| 0:52:16| And in my opinion, I feel like that this board has done due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3136.0)|
| 0:52:20| So in that situation, I mean, I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3140.0)|
| 0:52:28| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3148.0)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3150.0)|
| 0:52:31| Mr. Moyers, if this vote were to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3151.0)|
| 0:52:37| can you explain what a hearing at this beer ward might look like and how that process might work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3157.0)|
| 0:52:45| Well, I suppose you would take the evidence from our beer board inspector from the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3165.0)|
| 0:52:58| would present all of the incidences that he alleges are associated with the operation of this restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3178.0)|
| 0:53:07| that he wishes to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3187.0)|
| 0:53:10| Mr. Jones could examine the inspector or make arguments that he wishes to make with regard to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3190.0)|
| 0:53:22| He could present his own witnesses in rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3202.0)|
| 0:53:28| And at the close of that, we would have a pretty solid record to send to a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3208.0)|
| 0:53:36| if the board decided to take action on the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3216.0)|
| 0:53:40| It would be probably a more solid record than we have heretofore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3220.0)|
| 0:53:47| It is to be noted that generally speaking, in writ of certiorari cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3227.0)|
| 0:53:53| no evidence can be introduced at the trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3233.0)|
| 0:53:57| So if all we have from the Sheriff's Department is our inspector's oral relation of the incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3237.0)|
| 0:54:08| that are alleged to have occurred at the bar, I cannot flush that out at court, at trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3248.0)|
| 0:54:16| You can't add to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3256.0)|
| 0:54:19| A certiorari action is a review of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3259.0)|
| 0:54:23| Similarly, Mr. Jones could not bring witnesses to testify at a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3263.0)|
| 0:54:28| So if you do something today, then what we have today is what we're stuck with when we get to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3268.0)|
| 0:54:35| If you give them a hearing, it will give both sides a greater opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3275.0)|
| 0:54:39| to flush out the evidence for and against some punitive action against this license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3279.0)|
| 0:54:47| and that's what would go to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3287.0)|
| 0:54:51| So if you feel like there's enough, then you can take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3291.0)|
| 0:54:59| If you feel like you want the opportunity to get a bit more evidence in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3299.0)|
| 0:55:03| to give the court a bit more to hang their hat on, then you can do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3303.0)|
| 0:55:11| If the court were to find that there weren't sufficient evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3311.0)|
| 0:55:18| then this body could then hold the hearing and take another action if it wished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3318.0)|
| 0:55:23| because it's not a finding on certiorari, it's not a finding that the board acted improperly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3323.0)|
| 0:55:28| although it tends to get couched in terms of arbitrary, capricious, and illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3328.0)|
| 0:55:33| What that really means is there wasn't sufficient evidence to support what the body did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3333.0)|
| 0:55:40| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3340.0)|
| 0:55:42| If you're comfortable with the state of the evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3342.0)|
| 0:55:45| if you're comfortable putting that in front of a judge, then you can act, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3345.0)|
| 0:55:51| If you'd like to put more in front of the court for the court's consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3351.0)|
| 0:55:56| then you could have another hearing and have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3356.0)|
| 0:56:03| I hope that explains it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3363.0)|
| 0:56:06| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3366.0)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3368.0)|
| 0:56:10| Just a thought, if Commissioner Lee's motion were to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3370.0)|
| 0:56:15| I might suggest that we do such a hearing by special call meeting of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3375.0)|
| 0:56:22| rather than try to fit it in around other potential applications and violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3382.0)|
| 0:56:27| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3387.0)|
| 0:56:33| I'm listening to all this, and I've been here for all this just like you guys have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3393.0)|
| 0:56:38| I think there probably is enough for me, but that may not be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3398.0)|
| 0:56:43| Ultimately, it may not be me that has to be convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3403.0)|
| 0:56:47| I've lived in the neighboring community my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3407.0)|
| 0:56:51| I know this place well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3411.0)|
| 0:56:52| I have said before, and I'll say again, I think it's a terrible place for a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3412.0)|
| 0:56:56| I think that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3416.0)|
| 0:56:58| And I think I know Commissioner Lee's heart in this situation and these types of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3418.0)|
| 0:57:04| But I do tend to trust her ear on this because I'm not an attorney, but she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3424.0)|
| 0:57:09| And in the way she hears what our law director is saying, I do tend to trust her ear in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3429.0)|
| 0:57:20| While, as I said, I think there's enough for me to take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3440.0)|
| 0:57:24| I'm going to support Commissioner Lee's motion for hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3444.0)|
| 0:57:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3448.0)|
| 0:57:29| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3449.0)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3451.0)|
| 0:57:33| Mr. Law Director, would you read that last sentence on the Tennessee Code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3453.0)|
| 0:57:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3460.0)|
| 0:57:41| Revocation, suspension, or imposition of a civil penalty may be made for any violation of the provisions of this article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3461.0)|

| 0:58:02| Those last few words is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3482.0)|

| 0:58:15| I mean, I know I would vote now or next month or whenever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3495.0)|
| 0:58:20| The standards to revoke this beer license, in my opinion, has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3500.0)|
| 0:58:25| They are a detrimental business to the safety and welfare of not only the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3505.0)|
| 0:58:31| but the officers that are coming there to stop the fights, to check all this stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3511.0)|
| 0:58:37| So, Commissioner Lee, I don't know how I'd vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3517.0)|
| 0:58:45| I mean, I may pass this first time, but, you know, I hate the word pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3525.0)|
| 0:58:53| I hate Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3533.0)|

| 0:59:08| This is not about that person, that 16-year-old that was served alcohol underage being raped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3548.0)|

| 0:59:27| This is about the safety and the welfare of the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3567.0)|
| 0:59:32| It's what this is about, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3572.0)|
| 0:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3574.0)|

| 0:59:39| Just for clarification again, Lieutenant Walker, you said the Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3579.0)|
| 0:59:45| cited them $1,500 for the May 9th incident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3585.0)|
| 0:59:50| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3590.0)|
| 0:59:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3591.0)|
| 0:59:52| And their citing was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3592.0)|
| 0:59:54| They were in favor to maintain law and order for the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3594.0)|
| 1:00:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3600.0)|
| 1:00:01| And then, refreshing our memories, when they had the full-blown fight in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3601.0)|

| 1:00:23| That was November 2nd of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3623.0)|
| 1:00:26| 22, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3626.0)|
| 1:00:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3627.0)|
| 1:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3628.0)|
| 1:00:29| And then, basically what Commissioner Frazier has said, that when their beer permit was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3629.0)|
| 1:00:35| suspended for 60 days that they were good as gold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3635.0)|
| 1:00:40| It was initially suspended for 30 and then the beer board extended it for another 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3640.0)|
| 1:00:44| so it was a total of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3644.0)|
| 1:00:46| And during that period of no beer sales, they had loud music complaints was basically all they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3646.0)|
| 1:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3654.0)|
| 1:00:55| So the suspension for 90 days did work, theoretically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3655.0)|
| 1:01:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3660.0)|
| 1:01:01| There was no major complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3661.0)|
| 1:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3662.0)|
| 1:01:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3663.0)|
| 1:01:04| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3664.0)|
| 1:01:06| I feel similar to Commissioner Buehler and Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3666.0)|
| 1:01:11| I've heard and seen enough personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3671.0)|
| 1:01:16| I also believe in due process, so I have no problem voting yes for giving them a hearing of sorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3676.0)|
| 1:01:25| If we are, I think we should continue the suspension of the license until that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3685.0)|
| 1:01:32| We should make the hearing November timeframe and have it then and talk about it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3692.0)|
| 1:01:46| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3706.0)|
| 1:01:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3707.0)|
| 1:01:48| I'd just ask the maker of the motion to maybe put a specific timeframe on the motion so we can have some direction of how long everybody would have to prepare if it were to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3708.0)|
| 1:02:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3721.0)|
| 1:02:02| I think giving some more months would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3722.0)|
| 1:02:05| Commissioner Lee, would you be willing to restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3725.0)|
| 1:02:11| Or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3731.0)|
| 1:02:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3732.0)|
| 1:02:13| I would make a motion that we set this for hearing in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3733.0)|
| 1:02:19| A special setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3739.0)|
| 1:02:22| Suspend the beer license for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3742.0)|
| 1:02:26| Until the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3746.0)|
| 1:02:28| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3748.0)|
| 1:02:29| With a hearing to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3749.0)|
| 1:02:30| With a hearing to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3750.0)|
| 1:02:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3754.0)|
| 1:02:35| Can you just restate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3755.0)|
| 1:02:36| Because I think that was a different motion than what we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3756.0)|
| 1:02:39| So it's suspension and hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3759.0)|
| 1:02:42| Or we started with just hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3762.0)|
| 1:02:45| Suspension and hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3765.0)|
| 1:02:47| Your motion is to suspend for 60 days and have a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3767.0)|
| 1:02:52| And at the end of 60 days have a hearing as in a due process hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3772.0)|
| 1:02:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3778.0)|
| 1:02:59| And if not, we totally take their license away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3779.0)|
| 1:03:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3782.0)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Law Director, is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3784.0)|
| 1:03:07| Well, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3787.0)|
| 1:03:08| I would just say that I don't know what 60 days, where it puts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3788.0)|
| 1:03:14| I think you might want to actually have a date and time certain that you set it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3794.0)|
| 1:03:22| If the beer board chairman wants to set that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3802.0)|
| 1:03:28| If we do 60 days thinking that we're going to be on this day two months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3808.0)|
| 1:03:34| we have meetings that start at 2 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3814.0)|

| 1:03:39| So I think you need to find a time where you have an hour or two free to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3819.0)|
| 1:03:45| So I would just, you can either leave it to the chairman to find a time that works for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3825.0)|
| 1:03:50| or we can set a specific date and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3830.0)|
| 1:03:53| I'll leave that to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3833.0)|
| 1:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3834.0)|
| 1:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3835.0)|
| 1:03:56| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3836.0)|
| 1:03:58| It hasn't been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3838.0)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3839.0)|
| 1:04:02| We have an amended original motion by Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3842.0)|
| 1:04:07| An amended motion, so the second can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3847.0)|
| 1:04:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3849.0)|

| 1:04:43| I thought we were going to do a special setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3883.0)|
| 1:04:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305620-beer-board?start=3885.0)|
