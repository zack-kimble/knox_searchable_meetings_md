| 0:05:11| Hearing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| I just want to ask, Mr. Heron, there are a lot of things going on with Dogwood Arts. If you wouldn't mind taking a moment to talk about some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=313)|
| 0:05:22| I'd love to. Thank you for the opportunity. I know most of you have heard our upcoming Chalk Walk event. Of course, it's not going to be happening in Market Square this year, but it's going to happen in neighborhoods all across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=322)|
| 0:05:34| So we're encouraging community members and families to sign up online on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| They can register for free chalk and pick it up from us and then create their own chalk masterpieces at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| We're encouraging neighborhoods to kind of come together if there's a community space. I know Seema and I talked a little bit about Victor Ashe Park being a great space for her neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| So going out into those spaces and creating their artwork and sharing that with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| We're all really wanting to get out and see each other again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| And so that's our first event coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| Of course, the Dogwood Trails open on April 1st and run through the whole month of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| So you can enjoy those by car, by walking, hiking, and there's 85 miles of Dogwood Trails throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| Then before the Dogwood Arts Festival, we have our Featured Gardens event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| That's two private gardens that will open to the public on April 17th and 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| And then everything kind of culminates at the Dogwood Arts Festival at the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| And that's April 23rd to the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=389)|

| 0:21:02| that'll unmute you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| This is a long distance number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| I don't know where these people are calling from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1269)|

| 0:21:25| I wanted to remind everybody that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| because we've been seeing some more delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| with construction and approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| because of some of the issues we're dealing with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| it is something you can certainly consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| to give a 90-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| if that's something you're willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| If somebody comes and turns in their application early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and has all their documents together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| they won't be penalized by having extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| So that brings us to our first item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| which is 5A, Crap Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1322)|

| 0:22:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Kenny Shimino, 417 Gay Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| Okay, looks like you still need building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| fire and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Are you making any progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Final cleanup is May 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| They turn everything over to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| and by that time everything should be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| And we should be open by the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| So it's been going good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Chairman Roberto, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| I know that we've had this one out for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Looks like back to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| But on the first documentation that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| it says that the current business license expired on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| looks like in 2015-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Can you confirm, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| that you do have an updated business license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| I just need to get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| You need me to bring it down to y'all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Mr. Byrd, is that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| that you'll want him to present to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| I was gonna say, I can confirm it's current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Once the initial license is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| what happens is the business is renewing annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| through the Department of Revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| but the portal is showing that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| With that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I will approve pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| or completion of the work that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| It sounds like it's only gonna be a couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| so I think I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| I've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| I think we're looking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Yeah, we need an extension is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| So we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1475)|
| 0:24:35| We need an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| He's got, he said that he'll be ready May 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| but remember, he's not penalized if you give him 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| He can turn it in early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| It just doesn't end up back on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| It gives him extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| So does that give you enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Oh, yes, ma'am, it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Now, if we open before 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| I don't need to come back to the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I just have to turn my documents into the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Once you've got all of your completed documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| you turn them into Mr. Byrd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| you will be good to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| and you'll only show back up on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| if you go longer than 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| That sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I'm hoping I'm praying way before that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| It's been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| Yeah, well, we appreciate your patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| and not giving up on the project, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So I'll go ahead and make a motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1554)|

| 0:26:38| If they're here, they're a caller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I'll enable them to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| There's only one caller in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Need to select star six, unmute yourself caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Phone number ending 1-0-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1607)|
| 0:26:57| Are you here with us for Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| They still haven't unmuted themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Mr. Byrd, I know you had spent some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| trying to connect with the folks from Pete Cook Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Can you tell us about your efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Yes, sir, yeah, I've had no success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We had a previous email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| that we'd communicated on originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| And so I've, of course, sent them several communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| to the login info and reminders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| that everyone else got to that email, but no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| A kind of separate request to call me and let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| they're still there and no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And I have two numbers in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| One of them is a non-functional number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| And the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I've left a couple of urgent voicemails on, no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| Looked up a separate number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| from the business's Facebook page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| that the owner has a food truck, a separate business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| but didn't get an answer at that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| I've previously sent certified mail early in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| and it was initially received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| but then a subsequent certified was not picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| It was returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| So I didn't want to send again to a dead address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So the last time he was on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| I spoke with him briefly at one of these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| and he said he would call me back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| and then nothing since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Well, I think our options would be to give an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| or Mr. Frost, if we don't give an extension, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| If no extension is given, it automatically dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| If this gentleman decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| that he does actually want to do the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| later on down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| that does not prejudice him from coming in again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| and beginning the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| I mean, I feel like we've taken all reasonable measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| to reach out and contact this business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| At this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| So I'm not necessarily inclined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| to request additional extension at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. Frost procedurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| we just wouldn't take any action on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| and that would have that same result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Yeah, if you hear no motion, the matter is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Hearing no motion, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| Mr. Johnson, have we had anyone come to visit us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| from West Baxter Market in Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| The queue has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| The caller is still present and they're not responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| and no one else has joined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Well, we don't have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Did Mr. Berg, did you have any contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| with the folks at West Baxter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Yeah, we've spoken by phone and email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| He's emailed me documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| I've sent even a reminder call to all the app| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| or not a call, but a reminder email to the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| a couple of hours ago, as recently as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| but I'm not sure what might've happened to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| He's been engaged, but I don't know what's happened today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Maybe something came up unexpected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Well, Mr. Frost, on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| is it appropriate for us to go ahead and delay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| for our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Yes, that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| The ordinance requires that the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| or the owner's representative appear at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| So if they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| your only thing you can do is postpone it or it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Since-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Chair Roberto, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I'm sorry, I think I started talking over Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Mr. Frost, do you want to finish your statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1892)|
| 0:31:42| I don't hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| He's muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Since this is the first time he's appeared on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I think it'd be reasonable to postpone to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| So I'll make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| So that'll be a postponement to our April 20th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| All right, hearing no discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Mr. Johnson, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1933)|

| 0:32:34| And Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| All right, so we'll hear that one in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| There's no more items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1963)|

| 0:32:54| where he was able to detail for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| the extent that he tries to connect with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-210323?start=1977)|
